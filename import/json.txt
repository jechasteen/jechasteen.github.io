							"__cdata": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had found a mistake the day before. Not a major mistake, just a little one, but one that would cause major headaches down the road. I'm an indie game developer, in other words I'm unemployed, really. Well, that's not entirely true. I have a steady stream of income from YouTube videos and I just opened up a Kickstarter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To be honest, I'm getting kind of tired of this life. I want to just go back to having a regular old job, but really I'm unemployable. I'm unmanageable. So, I spend my days hunched over like a troglodyte in front of these glowing boxes typing code. This game's going to be good, I can feel it. Just let me get it finished, then beta tested, then released, and the rest will take care of itself. The game, if you want to call it a game, is this: equal parts World of Warcraft and social media. Log in to your new life, I want to say. Delusions of grandeur: people will live inside my game, they will convert their fiat currency for my in-game crypto. The computers of players mine the crypto, behind the scenes, but they don't get to keep it. It goes into the pool.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you've been staring at code for hours per day, most days each week, most weeks for well over a year, staring at the same lines of code, staring at new lines even, one can easily become disoriented. I begin to see the code as more real that the things happening around and inside of me. My office put together inside of the walk-in closet in my bedroom. I go into the office and the world disappears behind me. Staring at the screen, trying to solve problems, typing furiously, sometimes cursing to myself. It's all part of the process, especially the cursing part. But I don't know, I think I need to take a break. I need a vacation, but I feel like I haven't earned one until I officially release the game.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My desk is made from an old door someone left at the curb on bulk-pickup day. I walked that son of a bitch home and attached some legs I had bought years ago at Ikea. It's a perfect desk, just the right size, even has a little hole to poke all the cables through. Two monitors, one for writing code, the other for documentation and other stuff. The cheapest keyboard money can buy, rubber domes. An expensive mouse, though, I don't know what I'm doing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The bug I've been working on today involves the way that crypto integrates with the in-game merchants. There is a way to exploit the merchant interaction window to cause the player to receive currency instead of spending it. Interact with a merchant, open the console, type <code>mc.exch_rate=-1</code> which sets the exchange rate. The console needs to stay, but it can't allow players to make changes to the game state, even on their own machine. Did I mention I'm a terrible developer? Whatever, it's not like I'm the only shit dev out there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

I press the button and feel it click, and the computer comes to life. The fans spool right up to top speed, then ramp back down to idle. It sounds like a diesel truck accelerating, its engine climbing RPMs in first gear. Then, the CDROM drive does its thing. Yes I have one. The grunting sounds it makes are antiquated, reminding me of a floppy drive. Floppies are really only marginally more obsolete.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My tower is lit all in blue, with blue plastic accents on the front bezel. Fans on the top and back glow blue, too. When I built the thing about 3 years ago, I decided to cheap out on the case, but to be honest, I'm pretty satisfied with it. Looking through the cheap plastic window doesn't bring me joy, though. After 3 years worth of tiny scuffs and scratches, it is dull and cloudy. I went to Microcenter the other day and saw several beautiful cases with side panels made out of tempered glass. It would be luxurious, but $100+ is too rich for my blood. Plus, I have been collecting stickers on this case, so it has some sentimental value now. A metallic \"no smoking\" sticker, a \"wall art\" decal that says \"amazing,\" one Apple sticker for each of my iPhones, and many others.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

If I manage to save another couple thousand credits, I'll be able to buy it. It's certainly not the best T3 out there, but it's made me a ton of money in the last 3 years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Come on! Let's move, dude.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We're real close to this one, but we've gotta move fast. It's a competitive game, although not a lot play. First one on the scene usually gets the bounty. It's a P3, a Mercedes AMG C32, to be exact. It would almost be worth it to just steal the damn thing, but nobody ever gets away with that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My rented hanger on Shell-Exxon Station has seen better days. I've been so busy trying to pick up extra jobs the shop is trashed. I come out of the office to find Jack at his terminal, drinking his lunch with his left elbow on the desk, just scrolling through his feed staring blankly at the screen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"God dammit, Jack! Let's fuckin' go, dude!\" If he weren't my wife's brother I'd can his ass. \"If we miss this job, I'm not paying you for today.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You can't do that,\" he says without a hint of humor. He's right, though. God, I want to murder him.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Get your ass in gear, we leave in 3.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had already keyed on the 304 from the office. I walk toward the port side and the ramp opens with the hissing sound of hydraulics. It reaches the ground just in time for me to walk up it. Inside, I find another mess. Bottles everywhere, Jack's meal smoothies. The passenger compartment lights up as I enter, revealing more mess.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I ease into the Captain's chair, sinking into its luxurious padding. The main systems are still off, it's still going through warm up. I pull up the pre-flight checklist on the console and begin to run through it. Cockpit? Ready. Controls at zero? Check. Fuel quantity? Check. Flight plan submitted? Check.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, I just have to wait for ignition. And for Jack to get his ass on board and strapped in.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Jack! Jack, god dammit. Motherfucker!\" I swivel the chair around and see him walking toward me. Not picking up his feet, just dragging them across the ground. Ugh.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As he enters the cockpit, the engines ignite. \"Timed it just perfectly, man. I know what I'm doing.\" I'm going to murder his ass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"SESS traffic control, hangar bravo two niner, lima mike three zero four dash eight niner alpha, requesting clearance for egress, flight plan seven zero charlie eight eight, direct to ISS.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>&lt;&lt;\"lima mike three zero four dash eight niner alpha, flight plan seven charlie eight, direct to iss, clearance granted.\">></em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I press the \"auto\" button, it automatically takes me out of the hanger and into traffic. Once in traffic, I take over the controls. Traffic near SESS has been out of hand lately. Ever since the Ford FA-1C0 came out, low orbit has been packed with tourists driving like it's their first time in space.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Jack, grab me a beer.\" I've stopped drinking, except at the helm. I'm just a better pilot with a bit of suds in my belly. It calms the nerves and dammit you're not my mom. I keep a small supply in a compartment hidden in the floor of the cockpit closet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jack audibly rolls his eyes, but still gets up and gets the beer. \"You know, you're going to die from drinking this stuff.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Fuck off.\" I crack it open, take a swig, and put it in the cup holder below the console. Beer is increasingly hard to come by. I'm still sitting on about 600 packets, bought before the new regulation took effect.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now outside station traffic, I can really get up to speed. I gently increase thrust, really pushing the speed limit. I've never gotten a ticket, knock on wood. I'd like to think I'm pretty good at pushing it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple minutes later, we arrive near ISS. Now we just have to locate the Mercedes. Easier said than done. Autopilot joins us up with traffic, a constant stream of ships circling clockwise about 3 clicks away from the station.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Do you see it?\" Jack operates the camera controls, panning and zooming, looking for the Mercedes, license plate GXD4857.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Not yet, at least. I'll find it once we get out of traffic.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"ISS traffic control, lima mike three zero four dash eight niner alpha, requesting clearance for ingress, flight plan seven zero charlie eight eight, repossession.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>&lt;&lt;\"lima mike three zero four dash eight niner alpha, flight plan seven charlie eight, ingress granted.\">></em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I push the joystick, and the 304 banks hard starboard. I figure we probably have about 3 minutes before someone beats us to it. I lean forward in my seat to get a better angle out of the viewport.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've made about 200 repos at ISS, so I've got a pretty good method. Traffic control allows repo men to make only 5 passes, so I start with the entropy displacement station, and work my way outward from there. They're almost always moored at ED.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Got 'er, about 1200 meters, 2 o'clock.\" Jack's one redeeming quality is that he's actually pretty good at spotting, I hate to admit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Confirmed visual.\" I gently manipulate the controls to bring us into tractor range of the C32, turning the hull so that the bay faces it, topside toward.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Engaging tractor.\" In my haste to arrive first, I forgot to do the math for tractor power. \"Tractor set to... 58.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The tractor engages the C32, relief washes over me. I'm getting this one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The tractor seems to be struggling to pull the craft. \"Increasing tractor power, 65.\" This small adjustment seems to be enough, the C32 picks up a little bit of speed as it is pulled toward the cargo bay. God it's a nice ship. Gold accented control panel and leather upholstery visible through its viewport. This sucker is brand new, still has dealer decals. Those usually burn off within the first few weeks. How do you default on a weeks old lease? I guess they chose weekly payments. Idiots.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's about 2 minutes until the ship comes to rest in the cargo hold. After it sets down, I close the bay door. \"Alright, Jack, tie her up.\" Jack unfastens his restraints and walks out of the cockpit. I bring up the cargo hold camera on the console display just to make sure he doesn't fuck up. I see Jack walking ever so slowly toward the repoed ship. He pulls the clips up out of the floor, and gently loops them around the landing gear pulling them tight. After double checking, he turns toward the camera and gives a thumbs up. Fuck I hate that guy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Alright, get back up here. Make it fast, dumb ass.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

							"__cdata": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For most of the previous decade, Wittie worked at a number of different Jammin' Joe's coffee shops, a chain of drug dealerships where people go to type the next great American novel, to meet for work, or to listen to local musical acts in addition to getting their fix. After years of being used up by the job, she was practically gone. Wasted away.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Starting a new job is always stressful. It makes one feel like a foreigner. Makes one feel both useless and powerless. You're overwhelmed in a way that feels like culture shock, the shock of being dropped head first into a de facto sub-culture created by the employees.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But Wittie had to quit, there was really no other option. She had begun to turn to hatred in most interactions with both coworkers and customers. The cloying smell of mocha infused her uniform and even her hair, it never seemed to go away, even after washing. It haunted her.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The job had already taken her soul, now it was taking the only thing left to her: sleep. She would lie awake at night remembering the things she had done and said. As a result, she would find herself falling asleep at the worst times. She began falling asleep in the car, on break, at dinner with family, anywhere but in bed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Falling asleep at the wheel on her way home one afternoon settled her mind into the idea of finding a new job. She was driving her usual route through town, mostly side-streets, about three miles, when started nodding off on Fox Road, a fairly straight section of road between neighborhoods. The jostle of the passenger side tires slipping off the paved road thankfully woke her up. She narrowly avoided putting the car in the shallow ditch by mere inches. Afterward, her heart was pounding so hard, she could feel it in her eyeballs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She gave Joe's two-weeks notice, in spite of the cries of her soul. Her soul would have preferred her to just stop showing up. Her mind, however, was acutely aware of the injustice and selfishness of that. If one thinks they do any damage whatsoever to a corporation by quitting suddenly, they are dead wrong. Quitting suddenly would only affect those people who shared shifts with her, not anyone in the corporation, and certainly not the corporation itself. They would have her shifts replaced within the week, and the business would keep rolling.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie gave her two weeks notice in writing, then was persuaded to work a third. She hadn't locked down a job by the end of the first week, so she felt safest staying on at Joe's another week. By the beginning of the third week, she had been offered a job at Roger's Market, a national grocery chain. Joe's and Roger's, polar opposites in most respects, share one common thread: corny decorations. Joe's walls are decorated with pictures of musicians and bands who had never seen the inside of a Joe's, let alone that particular location. Roger's is decorated like some kind of tiki shipwreck.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The new job will be quite an adjustment for Wittie. The job --- explained to her as \"putting shit on shelves --- was classified as third shift pharmacy stocker. Fine, as long as she doesn't have to deal with shitty, entitled, drug-addicted customers anymore.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She started the job on a Sunday night at 11pm, arriving a few minutes early to give herself a little time to get her bearings. She sat in the car before going inside for about 15 minutes, giving herself a morose pep talk. This should be good. Seems like it should be fairly solitary, plenty of time to think. You've been lacking introspection time for years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie doesn't practice any religion, per se. She considers herself a humanist, but steals practices from disparate religions as she sees fit. For example, she used to meditate for half an hour each day, first thing in the morning. She intends to use this job like meditation, for introspection, to search her soul for answers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At five minutes before 11, she left her car and walked toward the front entrance of the store. The Roger's was the anchor store for a pathetic strip mall. Half the units seemed to be unoccupied, and the ones that are occupied are typical to say the least. A tanning salon, a massage place, a Chinese restaurant called literally \"Chinese Restaurant,\" and a hair stylist. Set in the parking lot near the street are a few fast food places and a bank. Standard strip mall fare.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie had, at one time, thought herself too good for jobs like this. She took the job at Joe's as temporary while going to school. During her first year working there, she had dropped out of school. Growing resentment toward the establishment replaced her youthful curiosity. After having gone through three aimless years at University without having declared a major, she dropped out in an attempt to find herself. What she found was the truth. The truth that no one cares what you are inside, they don't care to hear your opinions. Each and every person is more concerned with their next move, their next words, than with what goes on around them. This realization was the genesis of the hatred that consumed her at Joe's.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Coffee people are just drug addicts in expensive clothes who live relatively normal lives. Caffeine addicts don't normally drink themselves out of house and home; the fix is too cheap. It is just harmless enough to become commonplace, and just commonplace enough not to require strict control.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Working mornings at a coffee shop, you don't see people at their best. You see the addict seeking his fix. It would be less stressful to deal actual drugs. If you're rude to your dealer, they might stop serving you, give you weak shit, or otherwise fuck with you. The people dealing caffeine don't have the option. Corporations like Joe's treat their customers like petulant children, they practically train their employees to coo and stroke their faces. Putting shit on shelves should be a breath of fresh air compared to the noisome coffee shop.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She was told to report to the pharmacy after clocking in, so she hit the time clock and then meandered across the front side of the store. She looked from side to side, taking in the odd decorations. Multiple canoes filled with vines and moss, oars, tiki faces, unlit torches peppered in here and there, grass skirts wrapped around check stands, and rope nets among many other nautical and tiki themed decorations. She thought it an odd theme for a grocery chain based out of Ohio.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie looked to her left down each aisle as she walked past, seeing besieged shelves in a state of disarray. To her right, the check stands, a couple of them were still open serving the last few customers. The store closes at 11, but some people always wait until the last minute. Wittie thinks about the people who arrive at the coffee shop first, usually the same five or ten people. She chuckled, wondering which group of people were worse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No one was at the pharmacy when she arrived. She checked the time on her phone: 10:58pm. She shrugged and took a seat in one of the fake leather chairs they have for the elderly waiting for their scripts. She peered into the pharmacy through the plastic windows. A curtain made of metal bars was pulled down behind the openings. Though closed, it seemed like all the lights were still on inside the shop.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"No sittin' down on the job.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She heard the loud voice coming toward her from the left, a man, medium pitched but gruff. She stood up and turned toward the voice. It came from a bearded man with very black hair, as if it were recently dyed. He wore a baseball cap with a Toyota logo embroidered on the front. Despite the dress code being any solid colored shirt and jeans, he wore a threadbare yellow polo shirt tucked into cheap cotton slacks in black, the old uniform. His name badge said, \"RICKY,\" the letters worn to nothing in spots.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Sorry, I'm just starting tonight. I was told to meet Jason here,\" Wittie said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ricky walked past her and disappeared down one of the pharmacy aisles, saying nothing. She shrugged it off, the H.R. manager had warned her about some people. He didn't mention any names, but the way he said it made it seem like it was most of them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie stood there waiting for Jason until about five after, and when he didn't show she decided to look for him. The pharmacy shop was in a separate room in the front right corner of the store. Five aisles, indigestion to incontinence and everything in between, that face the opposite direction compared to the rest of the store. She walked outside the pharmacy alcove and looked right toward the back of the store, seeing a set of double doors marked with bold red text. She starts walking that direction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The double doors burst open with a loud BOOM-THWACK and through them came a giant red-haired man with extremely pale skin pulling a cart piled high with boxes of all sizes. His eyes were transfixed on a spot on the ground about 5 feet in front of him. As he approached, she stood to the side trying in vain to get his attention. He pulled the cart straight past her, then made a quick left down one of the pharmacy aisles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The man came barreling around the corner of an aisle behind her, headed back the way he came. \"Excuse me,\" Wittie hollered after him, \"I was told to report to Jason, do you know where he is?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The man never stopped walking, but slowed down and, with a slight look over his shoulder, made a swiping gesture with his hand that said \"come along.\" She skittered to catch up to him.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She followed behind him as he went back through the double doors. The back hallway smells strongly of cardboard, as if the baler compressed the smell too. She follows the ruddy man through the baler area to the loading dock.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dock reminded Wittie of a half gymnasium. Where the bleachers should have been were giant steel shelves loaded with pallets on three levels. On the wall to her right, dull metal roll-up doors sat in various states of openness along tracks that reached all the way to the ceiling. A couple of them were open into trailers, one of which is currently being unloaded, the other filled with pallet stacks and cardboard. One door was open a couple feet --- presumably for airflow, although it doesn't seem to be helping.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The mute redhead approached an older lanky man. His hair was almost entirely white where it showed beneath his hat --- a standard issue cap with a patch embroidered with a vintage-looking \"R\" logo. The mute fat man gestured toward Wittie, then walked past toward a pallet piled high with boxes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You must be new in pharmacy,\" Jason says, as if it were a question. He slips his work gloves off, and slips them in his back-left pocket. He extends his hand, with a smirk he says, \"Jason, I'm the warden.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Wittie. Nice to meet you,\" Wittie said, shaking his hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jason walked toward the hallway, Wittie followed side by side.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Well, the job's real simple. That guy, Ken, he'll bring shit for you to work, most o' the time just a couple o' rollers. You open all the boxes and put that shit on the shelves. If you have trouble finding where somethin' goes, set that shit aside and try again later. Trust me, it works. Match the UPC on the product to the shelf. Grab a shopping cart or two for your cardboard. Let me know if you need help with the baler. You get two 15-minute breaks. Take 'em whenever you want.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie just stood and looked at the old man, trying to piece together a response. Instead, she could only think about what the job must have done to his body over the years. Although he was tall, he still managed to stand up straight. He put on a good front, but the weariness was evident in his movements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Any questions,\" Jason asked, obviously eager to return to his own work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Nope, if I think of anything, I'll come find you.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She walked out of the hallway through the double doors, attempting to put on an air of confidence. Just put the shit on the shelf.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie walked up to the front, to the lobby and got a shopping cart, then returned to the pharmacy to find the roller that Ken pulled out. After working for a few minutes, stocking here and there around her five-aisle area, she realized that she was pretty much alone in the pharmacy section. Wittie let herself get lost in the rhythm of cutting open the boxes and emptying them onto the shelves. She was about halfway done with the roller, when Ricky came by again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You gotta make sure you're puttin' stuff ina right spot. I'm sick of findin' stuff ina wrong spot,\" the middle-aged man said dully, with a tinge of anger. She could tell that it was directed at her --- she was alone in there, she was sure of it --- as though he could have already found something she had put in the wrong spot. She was certain she had been alone since she started. Plus, it seems like this is her area, not his. Why does he keep walking through here?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I just started tonight, Ricky, no need to be a jerk,\" she said, but not before he had already left the aisle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I already hate that guy. I should see if anyone knows what his deal is.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After Ricky broke her flow, Wittie realized that she had been at work for almost 3 hours and was almost glad that the jerk had interrupted her. A little less than half of the roller still remained, but Jason had told her she could take her break any time. She took her shopping cart full of cardboard back to the baler and dumped it all in, then returned the cart to the pharmacy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The store's break room was reached by going down the long back hallway, then climbing a staircase up to a mezzanine. The room had two folding tables along the wall on either side. Each table has 4 folding chairs pushed underneath. A kitchenette occupied the back left corner of the room. She didn't bring lunch, she just wanted a place to sit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The room was empty when she got there, but a twenty-something woman came up shortly after she sat down. The woman moved very slowly with plodding steps, her shoulders were slumped and her arms hung limp at her sides. The skin around her bloodshot eyes was dark and swollen, the rest of her face sallow and mottled.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not wanting to be rude, Wittie said a quiet, \"Hello.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Hi,\" the woman croaked, eyes focused on nothing, then shuffled over to the TV mounted on the wall. She turned it on and changed the channel to an infomercial for an all-powerful skincare regimen. She dropped into the chair nearest the TV, slumped onto the table, and promptly fell asleep.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie decided she would ask Jason about the guy if she got the opportunity. Hopefully, he would ask the guy to knock it off or something.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She scrolled mindlessly on her phone for a very quick fifteen minutes. When the time came, she got up and climbed down the stairs with hopping steps that made her ponytail bounce. As she rounded the corner where the stairs switched direction, a pudgy man of indeterminate age, with disturbingly asymmetrical facial features, came around the corner. The man's face quickly took on a crooked-smiled leer, following her with his head as she continued down the stairs. She switched to a normal walk as soon as she saw him, and followed his gaze with her own. Ugh.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She strode down the back hall, trying to put as much space as possible between herself and that... man. She hoped that she would see Jason on her way by the dock, but the dock was deserted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When she got back to the pharmacy, Ken had brought her another cart of about the same size for her. She was just realizing that she would need to pick up the pace when Ricky came around the corner with a shit-eating grin on his pockmarked face.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I betchu thoughtchu only had the one roller,\" he said, then strode out of sight.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie went back to work with the pressure of anger building inside of her. Who does this guy think he is? Is he trying to run new people off? Savagely cutting boxes, she worked frantically and finished the remainder of her workload before her second break at 5am.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This break, she was the second person, the same woman as before was sleeping in the same spot. She wondered if the woman had been there the whole time. She hears snoring coming from the other woman. Not wanting to listen to the woman's gross mucousy snore, she turned around and walked back down the stairs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead, she would explore the store. To the right at the bottom of the staircase is another set of double doors that lead out between the deli and bakery departments. She walked past a refrigerated case filled with an assortment of brightly decorated ice cream cakes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Hi, there! You must be new, is this your first day,\" a woman's voice came from behind the bakery counter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie looks up to see a matronly woman smiling at her. She wore a white hairnet over her voluminous blonde hair. Her name badge said \"Cassie\" and was decorated with several pins and small stickers. \"Yeah, they've got me working in the pharmacy aisles,\" Wittie replied, returning the smile.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Well, whaddya think? Pretty nice not dealin' with customers,\" Cassie said with a self-congratulatory laugh.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yeah, I'll say so. My last job was at Jammin' Joes, so I know shitty customers,\" the younger woman replied. \"There's a guy over there, Ricky, who's been giving me grief though. Do you know this guy?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cassie racked her brain for a few moments and then, with an exaggerated a-ha moment, she answered, \"Yeah, that guy's an ass. I was out havin' a smoke a few weeks ago, an' he asked me if I had a smoke. I tol' him I cain't spare none, so he says 'I saw you got more smokes in there.' So I tol' him it's all I got. Can you b'lieve he tol' me to go fuck myself?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wittie shook her head, no. \"He came by earlier and accused me of putting stuff in the wrong spot, like as if he had been checking my work. Who has time for that?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Her elder shakes her head and laughs with her shoulders. \"I dunno, some people.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Well, I better get back to it. Nice talking to you.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You seem nice, I hope you stick around,\" Cassie said, looking back down at her work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She tried again to find Jason on her way back. She walked past all the grocery aisles, but saw no one at all. Just aisles with boxes strewn about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once again, she found a new roller at the pharmacy area. This time it was loaded with stackable crates, eleven of them. She peeked into the top crates and saw a variety of bottles, some loose and some strapped together with plastic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She went back to the lobby to retrieve another shopping cart, then she dumped the first crate out into one of the carts. She felt like a genius, one cart for trash, one for product.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Ya not s'posed to work outta carts.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This time she only heard the voice, never laid eyes on the bastard. She was certain that Jason had told her to use shopping carts, so she paid no attention to Ricky's admonishment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She managed to finish with a few minutes to spare, which she spent looking for Jason. She started at the dock, then walked down the back hall, then went through the double doors near the break room, then went around the front of the store. The aisles were mostly cleaned up, product on the shelves and looking nice and neat. Finally she found him in the cleaning products aisle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Hey Jason, I finished,\" she said as she approached the man. He was down on his knees straightening the bleach on the bottom shelf. He struggled to get up, taking a while to do so.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Good, good. Hope you didn't have any trouble,\" he said once he had stood up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Nope. I wasn't expecting the crates at the last minute, those were pretty time consuming, but I got there\" she replied.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Well, thank you for finishin'. I'm impressed, this was a pretty big delivery.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Oh, thanks! Hey, I've been trying to find you all night to ask you about this Ricky dude. What's his deal?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The man's face, which had been amicable, turned dark in an instant. Fear ran across his face chased by anger.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Ricky? How do you know about Ricky? Ricky killed 'imself in the bathroom last week.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

							"__cdata": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Denver, the Capitol of the Grand Unified Empire of the People, is home to more than 12 million people just in city limits alone. It was a sensible choice to build the capital, sea levels rose almost 20 meters in the decade after the point of no return, burying virtually all coastal cities across the globe. It didn't happen over night, mind you. It took the entirety of the 30s. The migration didn't begin in earnest until the waters touched their feet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The People's Empire, they call it, but sensitive readers will understand that the people do not have the control they are purported to. In the early 2040s, after the coasts were all but destroyed and well over 100 million people lost their homes and ways of life, the shit really hit the fan. Potable water shortages had been a latent threat for decades, but in the 40s there was really no water. The poor were hit especially hard. The Nestle corporation has a stranglehold on the bottled water industry. They pumped gallon after gallon out of public aquifers, pumping many of them dry, and milking the people dry of their money at the same time. If you could not afford the $5/liter cost, you had two options: die of thirst, or work for Nestle. They paid in water, using the current market price of water. The minimum wage minus the cost of the water you consumed. After buying food at the company store, people often had nothing left.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a result of this practice, the people of the United States staged a revolt. The world joined in support of the revolt, staging similar revolts in their respective homelands. Out of the madness rose a magnanimous figure, an orator with a silver tongue, to lead The People's revolution. A man of modest origins, he promised to share water. He promised a sort of communism of natural resources, food and water. The People's Army, led by Michael Jean, rose to power and unified the global revolt under a new banner, The Grand Unified Empire of The People, supposed to be a Republic Empire. An Emperor as the figurehead, with a senate composed of elected representatives. Their constitution, however, was anything but republican. The people had been swindled into yet another fascist state.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But a state that provided them with rations they so desperately needed. The propaganda machine was powerful, therefore the people were happy in their poverty and squalor. Not long after the rise of the People's Empire, the great lakes region grew tired of sharing their wealth, tired of their lack of control of it. With no central leader or authority, they built walls. Walls, speckled across a wide swath of the northern mid-west, built by the hands of volunteers, to slow the Empire down. In the mid-50s, they codified their state with a constitution of their own, not recognized by the GUEP even to this day. They call themselves the Great Lakes, and they are, as far as I know or can tell, the only free state left.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As part of the propaganda machine, the GUEP began work on The People's Library. The library was intended to be the replacement for the former US's Library of Congress, a store-room of fact and a curated collection of history. Its concrete edifice stands atop the site of the former Denver Central Library, a brutalist building with imposing stature. From the street, one would think it a bulwark or military installation, it has arrowslit-style windows every meter or so across the entire perimeter. The interior is magnificent, on the walls are hung the trophies of the Empire, the greatest artworks of the 20th century and beyond.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To enter the building, one must scan his or her valid state ID card and biometrics. After admittance, massive concrete door opens, allowing one and only one to enter the Grand Foyer, a giant rectangular open room with 30 meter ceilings, curved staircases on either end. The staircases lead up to the stacks, the lower level contains offices, terminals, and several auditoriums of various capacity. The wall separating the foyer from the rest of the library is composed of giant panes of glass. The doors are glass too, sliding to the sides as one approaches.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The terminal room is always packed with people, at all times of day and all days of the year. The majority of the populace is far too poor to afford access to the internet, let alone a terminal to connect to it with. One walks through the lower level doors directly into the terminals room and witnesses a throng of unwashed masses spaced out staring deep into glowing monitors. Each ID card is allotted 2 hours of terminal time per day and there are 1,200 terminals in total. The wait time for terminal access can stretch into the tens of hours on particularly busy days, but people still stand in the line. The queue is a snaking line that closely resembles an amusement park ride queue, taking up valuable space that could be used to hold more terminals, people would say. But, in reality, it is just the way they want it. More people waiting in line jonesing for their terminal time is fewer people waiting in chow lines, fewer people questioning the state of their reality, fewer people with the motivation and time to dissent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The upper floor of the Library is never trafficked. It contains all of the books approved by GUEP, over 400,000 tomes some of which were specially prepared to meet the propaganda requirements. I suppose it doesn't matter, few go there to read books, few even care. The ones that do have access to the internet and, therefore, the books in their original form. Being entirely decentralized, the Empire has no control over the contents of the internet as a whole. I often find myself there in amongst the stacks just to find a piece of quiet, a respite from the chaos that is the City of Denver. There is something quaint and old-fashioned about the smell of the second floor. The dusty disused books smell of paper and adhesives, but the smell is oddly soothing. Like the smell of grandma's house, it reminds one of simpler times. It fabricates a memory of the time where the books were the source of information, the disseminator of thought and theory.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

The news is not good, The People are losing motivation as the war drags on. It would seem that The People will not capture the City of Chicago, that the Great Lakes will continue to stand free, holding the worlds most precious resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Peeking one eye around the corner, looking through the doorway into the throne room, Andreas sees the Emperor and his guards. The throne room is mostly dark, the only light comes in through stained glass windows. Looking at the windows, he tries to think of a time when this building was a church, a time long before his own birth. He tries to imagine the building as it was, before it had the icons of the Empire plastered to its walls, before it had a fools throne placed upon the dais.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jack is the second emperor since the point of no return.

Walking into the room causes the guards to come to attention, all of them staring daggers at him.

The FA-1C0 enters the from from the right, its hull seeming to vibrate to convey its speed. The pulse drive glows white, rolling like boiling water.\n\n                        NARRATOR\n            Meet the all-new 2107 Ford FA-1C0, according to\n            DrivePulse the fastest, safest, and most\n            reliable T6 in the galaxy.\n\nThe city of Detroit at sunset viewed from Lake St. Clair. The skyline glints and gleams in the long rays of light. The FA-1C0 zooms toward the camera, feet above the Detroit River, through the center of view.\n\n                        NARRATOR\n            Equally at home in atmosphere or space, the\n            pulse drive has been enhanced with breakthroughs\n            in thermal management engineering.\n\nA block diagram of the new engine, highlighting the new Entropy Conversion Unit.\n\n                        NARRATOR\n            You'll have fuel to spare after making three\n            trips around the globe, without even having to\n            stop for entropy displacement.\n\nEXT. SHELL-EXXON SPACEPORT\n\nThe FA-1C0 navigates amongst much bulkier, dirty ships, stopped for service. They are moored against an arm of the station. The FA-1C0 drives past the service station to the docks, spins around and backs up to a dock. It is unloaded, reloaded, and then drives off out of view.\n\n                        NARRATOR\n            Interplanetary delivery is where it really\n            shines. Backed by popular demand, Ford has\n            developed a pulse driven platform that can make\n            a round trip from Earth to Mars.\n\nINT. FA-1C0 COCKPIT\n\nThe cockpit door rolls up into the ceiling, revealing the dash panel. Its lights and screens glow in the dimly lit space. The camera moves forward, revealing the plush captain's chair. The dash is glossy carbon fiber, rimmed with a red pinstripe. The heads up display activates, seeming to rise from the dash.\n\n                        NARRATOR\n            Never lose a firefight to bandits again.\n            Microsoft HUDhub 8 provides all the targeting\n            and timing information you need to keep you,\n            your passengers, and your cargo safe.\n\nINT. HANGAR\n\nThe FA-1C0 sits on landing gear, with the bottom hatch open. A pair of pilots walk down the ramp, laughing together. Several white and red lights cast a glow underneath the ship.\n\n                        NARRATOR\n            Starting at 158,000 credits, you can't afford\n            not to drive one today. The FA-1C0 pays for\n            itself. Visit your Ford dealership today.\n            Special 1.9% financing available for well-\n            qualified buyers.</pre>\n<!-- /wp:preformatted -->"

							"__cdata": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've been getting a lot of suggestions related to music theory from YouTube lately, which is strange because I've never watched any such videos. I'm not really sure I've ever watched music-related videos before. Such is the state of the algorithm, I guess. Google knows I write music.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I happen to have 3/4 of a degree in music theory, thank you very much Google. I also happen to hate music theory. The rest of this is a diatribe explaining why.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've been studying creative writing lately. It's my hobby du jour. I've always loved writing, not for sharing but for conveying feelings from one side of my brain to the other, so to speak. Being a very analytical person, I have trouble understanding my emotions. Writing helps me to process. I've read four books about writing now, and there's one common thread throughout all of them: grammar is the last thing you should worry about. That's not to say that it doesn't matter. Good grammar does not make a good piece, good content does. Your personal voice, your message, and your story.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is exactly how I feel about music theory. Music theory is not my muse, and it's probably not yours. It is a bully pulpit for the gatekeepers of \"good music.\" Let me make one thing clear right now. If music theory is your muse, by all means let her inspire you. If you grew up listening to popular music, if you want to write music that reaches the broadest range of people, you probably want to find another way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Those of us who paid attention in our English classes have enough background in grammar to write. Right now, not after further study, not after understanding dangling modifiers. The difference being that most people didn't take music theory classes in school even if they were in orchestra, band, or choir.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That doesn't matter. Music theory is codified&nbsp;<strong>after the fact</strong>, by the study of what has already been written. Do you think that the composers of Gregorian chant knew music theory? No, but what they wrote mostly conforms.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So you, someone who loves music and wants to start writing, want to know. How does it all work, what are the rules? The fact is that there are no rules, per se. Your ear --- and our collective ears --- are the rule makers. The rules of music theory are based on what sounds pleasing to the ears, not commandments presented to the people by the gods of music on clay tablets.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of what you need to know to write music is contained in the airwaves. Listen. A lot. No, more than that. Not just listen, study, listen&nbsp;<strong>intently</strong>, even take notes. Figure out what they did, and try to understand why it works. Also, practice your instrument. A lot. No, more than that. Find your voice on your instrument. In my less-than-humble opinion, music is its own muse. She speaks to you herself,&nbsp;<strong>through you in the language of the soul</strong>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The more you listen, the better you understand what sounds good. The more you play your instrument, the better you understand what feels good. The more you write, the better you understand yourself, your voice, and your message. Don't let the fact that you can't convert a lead sheet to Roman numeral analysis. Sure, RNA is an incredibly useful tool, but it and its ilk can be a stumbling block.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you spend time studying something that doesn't bring you joy, that doesn't inspire you, it is a complete waste of time. Spend that time writing instead. Even if you end up throwing it out, like I have with most of my work, you might feel more satisfied than if you had spent that time memorizing the circle of fifths. Spend that time listening. Listen to music that&nbsp;<strong>speaks to you through the language of the soul</strong>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>P.S. For what it's worth, I love complex music. I curate an extensive (~17 hours)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2mcaV7RpnWsljHXutLGtQQ?si=96766ddd519b4fd2\">bebop and hard bop playlist on spotify</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

Today, we're going to go in the completely opposite direction. If you haven't read that post, you don't need to do so in order to follow this one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the last part, I made a bit of a hyperbolic statement: I hate music theory. That's not exactly true. The fact is, I hate music theory for the purpose of&nbsp;<strong>writing popular music</strong>. Music theory is not for writing popular music, it is for understanding complex works. It is a science of art, if there is a such a thing. It's like looking up at the stars in wonder, then studying astrophysics to figure them out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was perusing my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen\">GitHub repositories</a>, as I do from time to time to see if there's anything I'm interested in working on, and I stumbled upon a project I started during my sabbatical in 2019.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/Coltrane\">Coltrane</a>&nbsp;is a language for expressing chord progressions in a format that both humans and software can understand. It is currently a work in progress, but I still think its pretty cool where it stands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're an intermediate in music theory, reading through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jechasteen.github.io/Coltrane/book/index.html\">white paper</a>&nbsp;could help you to understand some fundamentals of chord progression theory, especially terminology.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like I said, I hate music theory. But I'm also fascinated by it. My all-time favorite genre is bebop. Yeah, I know. Pretentious af. Anyway, the best part about bebop is the virtuosity. The fluency with which they speak the language is astonishing, inspiring, and perpetually amazing. Bebop is not only wonderful to listen to without analyzing, it is fulfilling and fascinating when you do. Analysis is to peer through the eyes of the giants of jazz.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, like I said, music theory is not a great tool for composition. It can be, but not for me, and probably not for you. Unless you intend to write the next&nbsp;<em>Giant Steps</em>, that is.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're still interested in music theory after all this, welcome to the club. Have a read through the white paper, and come on back here with any questions or comments.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, we'll take a look at&nbsp;<strong>tonality in popular music</strong>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

Hebrews 12:10</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A lot of people these days seem to think that god, in his infinite wisdom, only wants for good things to happen to us. But, because of our sins, we bring pain and suffering upon ourselves. If I'm reading this passage correctly (I'm not), the suffering we endure is punishment and through it we find holiness. This passage makes me think of the self-flagellator with his cat of nine tails, who has taken this idea to an extreme. If I cause myself to feel pain, this will purchase some kind of forgiveness or make payment for a debt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think a better example of this might be a parent with a mentally handicapped child. There are some among us who would say that the child's deficiency was caused by sin of the parents. The child is a punishment, though they would surely never admit to it in those terms. No, god works in mysterious ways. Yeah, his idea of discipline is to confer it upon a soul with only the sociopath's idea of a connection to the grievance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But let's not forget that there are two parts to this verse. The dichotomy is actually pretty hilarious. I will attempt to paraphrase the verse in a modern (and probably more aggressive) way, and flesh out some of the implied meaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Your parents beat the shit out of you until you got big enough to fight back, but god will never stop beating the shit out of you. It makes you stronger, sissy.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;Lest we forget that god knows best, we must turn our asses upon him. We must allow him to tan our backside frequently, we must always seek discipline to attain a fragment of his holiness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My dad is a retired southern baptist pastor. I grew up in the church, his church, rather his many, many churches. I've read a solid portion of the bible, say 60%. I don't claim to be a biblical scholar and I don't put myself into situations where I have to debate with christians. It's not a sport to me, I don't enjoy that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I like to entertain ideas. Stick with me here. I mean entertain in the sense that you would entertain guests at your house, except in an ongoing sense. I realize that entertaining at your home every day would be a nightmare, but ideas are usually great house guests. They don't sit there with their phone out or yawn uncontrollably. They don't get too drunk and ruin your shit. Ideas are instantly your best friend, whether you agree with them or not. In the interest of full disclosure, this means sometimes they come into your house with saccharine sweetness, you're not really sure if you recognize them, and they later rob you. The fact is that, as you get more experience entertaining, you can see the signs before it's too late to do something about it. You need to see a few bad ideas, really get to know them, before you get the experience you need to make quick assessments.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I digress. My point is that I think there are 3 ways to read this verse, each one a bit more severe than the last.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Your parents did the best they could for you, but god knows better. Allow god to teach you that you may grow closer to him. (fuzzy)</li><li>Your parents are weak, but god is strong and his discipline is strong and you need it because you're weak and it'll make you stronger.</li><li>All of the things that go wrong in your life are the result of punishment meted by god, but it's cool because it makes you totally holier</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There's an obvious fourth interpretation being left out, but the atheists and humanists among us already know what it is and the christians are all sensitive and stuff.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Where do you stand on this idea? If you're not a christian (I'm an apatheist , fwiw), try do what I described above. Stand at the doorway of your mind, and assess this guest arriving uninvited. Is there an interpretation I'm missing? I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>[N.B. the lack of capitalization is intentional, in the interest of fairness to everybody and nobody.]</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

							"__cdata": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some time around 2008 or so I needed a laptop to replace my recently-obsoleted PowerBook G4. (Apple made the switch from PowerPC to Intel in 2006 IIRC.) I had been required to buy the PowerBook --- the university I was attending required it, ugh --- otherwise I would never have bought such a machine. It cost damn near three grand, a fortune for a kid who only made around $200 per week. I was lucky to have a generous benefactor, unknown to me, pay for the better part of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My next laptop was the polar opposite of the Apple in most ways. I ended up getting an Asus eeepc 1000HE at Walmart for probably about $300. Little did I know at the time, that laptop would change my computing world forever.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had been cursorily familiar with Linux at that point, having tried it on the PowerBook and live installs on flash drives, but the eeepc was my first daily-driving experience. It came preinstalled with Windows XP (in 2008!) that was serviceable, but very outdated. Windows 7 would barely run. A relative newcomer to the Linux distro world was my answer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Arch Linux was my first daily driver Linux distro. In case you aren't familiar, Arch is a barebones semi-DIY distro that you have to install very manually. Not as manual as Gentoo or Slackware, but close. No package compilation, but a completely command line install.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I don't recommend this route unless you either have a lot of spare time to dedicate to your new hobby (like I did) or are a masochist. You'll have lots of do-overs after fucking up and you'll run into problems you are not prepared to Google yet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These days, I sort of long term distro hop. My current daily driver is Manjaro, an Arch-based distro. I highly recommend it for an intermediate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Prior to that, I had been using Fedora for almost 6 months. Fedora is the testing distro that eventually becomes Red Hat Enterprise Linux, so it is very mature and easy to use. I highly recommend it for a beginner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this point, I've tried almost every mainstream distro and many niche distros, too. There are things I've loved about them all, but not enough to stick around. I do always seem to come back to Arch eventually, though. There's just something satisfying about really&nbsp;<strong>owning</strong>&nbsp;your OS. Plus, you can say \"I use arch, btw.\" I would absolutely recommend Arch for a motivated beginner. The supplemental materials at the Arch website are invaluable, whether or not you are using Arch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're reading this article, you may be overwhelmed at the astonishing number of&nbsp;<strong>mainstream</strong>&nbsp;distros. Debian, Ubuntu, Manjaro, Fedora, openSUSE, Mint. The list of popular distros is insanity, and the community is ambivalent about all of them. How do you pick a distro when each one has pros and cons you don't fully understand? Each one has a laundry list of superlatives extolling the virtues of its package manager or desktop environment, and just as many negatives. That's what my goal is here, to give you the base vocabulary and knowledge to make that decision&nbsp;<strong>for yourself</strong>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/posts/how-to-choose-your-first-linux-distribution.md#what-do-the-distros-have-in-common\"></a>What Do the Distros Have in Common?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite the fractured appearance, Linux is actually a homogenized ecosystem in terms of functionality. That is, every distro has&nbsp;<strong>categories</strong>&nbsp;of software in common. In addition, many of the programs you use on Windows or MacOS either have releases for Linux or open source (or closed source, in some cases) replacements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/posts/how-to-choose-your-first-linux-distribution.md#considerations\"></a>Considerations</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/posts/how-to-choose-your-first-linux-distribution.md#desktop-environment-de\"></a>Desktop Environment (DE)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For someone coming from Windows or Mac, the idea of a desktop environment is not separate from the OS itself. When you think of Windows, you think of the desktop, the start menu, explorer. For Mac, it's menu bar, the desktop, and finder. It's exactly the same idea on Linux, except each component can vary from distro to distro.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;I listed this \"component first\" because I think it's the most important. It's the stuff you look at and interact with on a daily basis. If you can't get around, you're going to be less productive. My advice is to skip the live USB rigamarole. It is a very time consuming and, honestly, frustrating process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Check out YouTube (I may have some demos soon, stay tuned, subscribe!) for videos demonstrating different DEs. Pick one that you think you can get along with and make a note of it then move on to the next item in my list.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some will use the terms desktop environment and window manager (WM) interchangably. They are actually different, but related, things. The WM is one of the components of the DE, the one that decides how to draw windows. It often will provide the taskbar and desktop, too. Don't be too concerned with the distinction, most of the time people are talking about the DE, not the WM, even if they are saying WM.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/posts/how-to-choose-your-first-linux-distribution.md#package-managers-and-software-centers\"></a>Package Managers and Software Centers</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm lumping the two together here because, under the hood, they are very closely related. A software center (by any name) is a GUI application that allows you to discover and search for new programs, but it uses the package manager to do the actual installing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm really only mentioning this because, as a newbie, you want to steer clear of&nbsp;<strong>rolling release</strong>&nbsp;distributions. That, in brief, means that update packages are available as they are released. Most distros don't use this method. Most release security updates relatively frequently, but the \"upgrade\" is very infrequent, typically twice a year or so. Rolling release distros are more prone to breakage, especially if you're not good about updating frequently. The problem is, the more packages that get updated, the harder it is to pinpoint the problem package if it borks your system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/posts/how-to-choose-your-first-linux-distribution.md#shells-and-the-terminal-emulator\"></a>Shells and the Terminal Emulator</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The terminal emulator is the text-based interface that you're probably dreading if you've done any Linux consideration or testing. Many of the solutions you'll find around the web are going to give you dense commands that will magically fix your system.&nbsp;<strong>Be very careful</strong>&nbsp;with these commands, they are capable of doing more harm than good. In addition, copy-pasting commands from the internet is extremely dangerous before you are able to read and understand them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're just starting out, make sure that the distro that you choose uses the&nbsp;<strong>bash</strong>&nbsp;<strong>shell</strong>. It is the most common by far, but there are popular distros that use others. You don't really need to know what bash means at this point. It is sufficient to know that if you copy a command from StackOverflow or try to run a&nbsp;<strong>shell script</strong>, it may not work unless you are using bash.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/posts/how-to-choose-your-first-linux-distribution.md#conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I hope that this info helps you to pick, and I hope that you have a great time learning Linux. Most of the information out there about distros is dense and hard to read, especially for a newb. I also think that people tend toward piety when it comes to their distro (or distros) of choice. Don't be that person. Embrace the variety, spread out in the wide open space. This is your journey.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Linux world is an excitingly varied one, an endless rabbit hole of discovery. It can be frustrating at first, but stick with it. It is very rewarding having complete control over your machine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have any questions, please leave them below.

Iliana poked her head in, just enough, keeping her eyes cast away from his nudity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Sir?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Get a pair of scissors. I need you to trim my pubes.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She had just begun her new position, maidservant to the Tristoff heir, two days ago. He had been away&nbsp;<em>on business</em>&nbsp;until late last evening. Their first meeting had been ... unfortunate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When he finally arrived, he came with a surprisingly old prostitute whom he apparently didn't want to fuck in his own bed. Iliana was in her closet, unpacking and organizing her clothes, when she heard the sounds of sexmaking. The groans and moans -- hers obviously faked -- came to an abrupt end after about 4 minutes. Iliana heard the faint tinkling of his belt and muffled conversation. She decided it might be safer if she announced her presence with a witness present. After a few beats, she walked out from the closet with her hands behind her back and her head down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'm sorry for the surprise,\" she said. \"I'm your new maidservant, Ilyana. I was rearranging my closet when you arrived.\" She trembled with fear -- she'd heard what had become of his <em>last</em> maidservant -- and she was barely able to speak.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What?\" Josun, quite drunk, had stumbled when he realized he wasn't alone with the prostitute. \"Who're you? What're you doin' here?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Iliana swallowed, her face colored. \"I ... I'm Iliana, your new maidservant.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What -- what were you doing in there?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I just moved the last of my things in today. I was organizing my closet. I didn't know what to do. I'm sorry.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The sixteen-year-old heir looked the prostitute up and down, and his shame flared. In the cold post-sex clarity, he saw all of her wrinkles, the way her earlobes sagged with the weight of dangly earrings, the black ghost of a mustache. He shuddered, pointed to the door, and commanded her, \"Out.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What about my money,\" she said, hips cocked and a hand on her hip. Her lipstick was smeared around her lips, making her sneer far less effective.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Send a bill,\" he said. \"Go!\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The prostitute was gone, but her cheap perfume hung in the hair like a threat. Josun turned to Iliana, looking like he was going to wring her neck. He was already practicing on his hands. Instead, he spun and strode out of the room and slammed the door.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The pubic hair request was her second impression.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She did it, of course, what else would she do. The term maidservant is a misnomer, she is a slave owned by the Tristoffs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Thank you, Iliana,\" he said when she finished, then added a perfunctory, \"sorry about last night.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"That's ok, sir. Already forgotten.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was an honest mistake, he wouldn't fuck a prostitute in&nbsp;<em>her</em>&nbsp;bed. He didn't realize it was her bed until he met&nbsp;<em>her</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He brushed away the loose hairs and examined himself in the mirror. \"Nice work, nice work indeed. They say trimmed hedges make the tree look bigger.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yes, sir.\" She had never heard that one before, but figured it was true enough. For him, though, even razing the bushes wouldn't help the tree.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>JOSUN</em>, a voice buzzed from the intercom.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Ugh, gods ... dad.\" He walked over to the intercom and pushed the button. \"Yes, Father.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>WE ARE GOING TO LUNCH WITH ABERNO ELDANA AND HIS FAMILY, LEAVING AT ELEVEN HUNDRED. YOU MUST NOT BE LATE.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'm always late because I'm hoping you'll leave without me,\" he said to himself, then into the intercom, \"Yes, Father.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Iliana helped him to pick a suit and tie for lunch, even helped him to get his tie knot perfect. She was surprised by how nice he was, he even seemed a gentleman toward her. The rumors were that his last maidservant had been raped and murdered, her body found floating face down in the Montrecka River, near the docks. Everyone thinks he did it, but charges were never filed. But all during the morning and through lunch he had been kind to her. She knew that his bad behavior was probably related to alcohol, so she was not looking forward to his return after the gala.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing at a time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After lunch, Josun and his attendants returned to his quarters so he could change into formal attire. His father had commissioned a suit for him, an Izzara original design, one-of-a-kind. The coat fit tightly around the waist and extended to mid-thigh. The pants were fit slim and straight, a black satin stripe along the outseam. Iliana didn't see what was so&nbsp;<em>original</em>&nbsp;about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The suit cost 11,000 credits. Iliana knows that because Josun told her so. A small fortune to someone like Iliana, life-changing money. Not \"fuck you money,\" but enough to buy her freedom, with a little bit to spare.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"How do I look?\" Josun asked, turning from the three-panel mirror in his closet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Splendid, sir. Very fashionable.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>JOSUN. JOSUN! WE LEAVE IN FOURTY-FIVE MINUTES. YOU WILL NOT BE LATE.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"The Savior's blood and guts,\" a new swear. He poked the intercom on the wall next to him and replied, \"Yes, Father.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>YOU WILL NOT BE LATE. YOUR LAST CHANCE. UNDERSTOOD?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He sighed, then forced himself to stand up straight, almost clicking his heel, and replied, \"Yes, Father.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Josun did not request Iliana's company at the gala, which she was glad for. She spent the evening in the venerable Tristoff family library, at the center of the mansion. The room had a mellow odor: leather, paper, adhesives, wood finish. The collection was so extensive, they employed a librarian full time. His name is Alaster, and he lives in an apartment above the library.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"There's a hidden ladder,\" he said with a sly grin. She mistook this as flirtation, but really he just loved showing people how the hidden ladder works, it's ingenious.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Where? I see the hatch, but there's nowhere a ladder could come from.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He sauntered underneath the hatch, which she also mistook for flirtation, then pulled on a sconce. It clicked into place, and what had been the support between two bookcases slid out, revealing a ladder. Iliana now sauntered over to the ladder and began climbing it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"How delightful!\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Uh ... Iliana, my bedroom is hardly --\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Oh I don't mind.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Alaster joined her in his apartment, and she managed to convince him to fuck her. He protested for much longer than they usually do, but she didn't mind the chase. Afterwards, she put herself back together as best she could, then went back into the library to browse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Compared to the rest of the mansion, Josun's quarters were scarcely decorated. Crossed swords above the mantlepiece, and a painting by one&nbsp;<em>Joshi D. Gosta</em>&nbsp;above his bed. When she returned from the library, she found a man standing in front of a console in the anteroom. He stood with his hands folded in front of him, staring straight ahead, and did not react when she entered.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She smiled, \"Hello, I'm Iliana. Josun's new maidservant. I'm sorry we haven't met.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"It is my fault, miss Iliana,\" he replied, with a bow. \"I was serving my punishment for contradicting master Josun, I only returned moments ago.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She supposed he had been thrown in jail, but wanted to look no further. They looked each other over for just a moment, each pitying the other.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"If I'm being honest,\" she replied, \"what you just told me terrifies me.\" A tense moment passed in silence, then Iliana snorted \"Good thing I'm not being honest.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The expression on the butler's face did not change, nor did he look at her. He stood just as he had when she first came in, erect, shoulders back, head held high.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"If you'll excuse me,\" he said with a bow, then right-faced and left Josun's quarters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Iliana shrugged. The butler -- damn, she didn't even get his name -- must have been born into this life. Probably raised from a babe to butle. He spoke of his punishment as if it were the most normal thing, something that he <em>deserved</em> even. She was a new slave, sold off by her own father desperate to pay Jerrod, a moneylender who had threatened to kill him. So he did what any despicable asshole would have done, he sold his daughter. The timing was fortunate -- for her to go to a \"good home,\" as her father had wished -- the requisitionist for the Tristoff estate happened to need a female. He was able to pay off the debt and then some.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Iliana returned to her private room and changed into her nightgown, then settled into the wing-back chair with a book.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Civique Museum of Arts hosts the gala event each year -- a fundraiser for their in-school programs. Truly a noble event, they raise millions and it basically all goes to the kids, really. It's a gaudy, high-fashion, party thrown inside the museum. A ticket costs 25,000 credits, it's a donation, mind you. Really cuts out the riff-raff.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not exactly, though. Sometimes the riff-raff finds a way to make him or herself into a millionaire, sometimes even a billionaire.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Josun spots the man from a distance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"This way,\" he said. His date -- Merida Amorath, a spectral horror chosen by his father -- had her arm hooked into his. He tugged on it and pulled her off to a hallway that flanked the grand ballroom.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You'll pull my arm off, brute,\" she spat. He continued to pull on her arm, she resisted him the whole time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Elias Cothbur.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Merida shrugged, said, \"I like him.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>I bet you like him. You're both a horse's ass.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"That may be,\" he said, \"but I don't. Let's go get a drink.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Down the hall a pair of doors were propped open. They heard the drums and bass first, then the vocals and guitars, then the cymbals -- The Krafters, <em>I Want Drugs</em>. Inside, the floor bustled with activity. A peppering of tables around the perimeter. In the center, a giant bar with stools all around it. A couple hundred of the richest and most influential people in Fosamar, standing around sipping cocktails and making connections.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She held him by the arm the whole way over to the bar, then sat down immediately. He had to get rid of her, get her a little tipsy and then pawn her off. He chose to stand, ordered their drinks and made polite conversation with a few people who passed. Each time her drink would get low, he would order her another, and another. She was no lightweight. The bitch had at least five drinks before she seemed to be having any fun at all. Josun waited until she was annoying the hell out of the guy on the other side of her, then slipped away.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He walked almost halfway around the room before he spotted her standing with a group of people, many of whom he didn't know.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You're finally a man.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The voice was irritating, as if you could&nbsp;<em>hear</em>&nbsp;the acne. Josun turned toward Elias, but not completely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"And so you now consider me fuckable?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Maybe I do.\" The hair on the older boy's face was slicked back with grease. It formed a cohesive shell with a mirror finish. He mimed slicking his hair back, then rubbed his hands together. Josun turned away to scan the crowd again. When he walked away, Elias said, \"Call me!\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Several people noticed his approach and faded from the group, leaving the remaining people looking around wondering what happened. Nyora never saw him coming, Josun approached from behind. When the remainder of the group saw him, they too fled, leaving Nyora alone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Hey Nyora,\" he said, causing her to tense every muscle in her body. \"All alone again, I see?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"They saw you coming, they had the chance to hide. I would have too if I had seen you.\" The young lady was beautiful, even with the look of disgust. Josun didn't seem to notice the way she was looking at him, or didn't care.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Oh come on, they just wanted to give us some space. Can I get you a drink?\" He had a practiced saccharine smile on his face, the snarl of a predator.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"No. For the last time, No,\" she said, her face beginning to flush, then added, \"Leave me alone!\" The last part was said in a way that carried through the ballroom over the volume of conversation. Soon, the whole room grew quiet, eyes searching the room to find the cause of the interruption. Soon all eyes were on the pair, drawn by the drama of the debasement of an heir to one of the most reviled houses in Fosamar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Josun looked around at the people staring at him, his face getting redder by the heartbeat. His fingernails dug into the palms of his clenched hands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Fuck you,\" he whispered to her, then spun and stormed out of the room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Conversation returned as soon as he turned, rising back to its previous level before he had left the room. He went out through the same doorway he and Merida had come in, then back down the hallway to the front of the building. The reverberant&nbsp;<em>clock clock clock</em>&nbsp;of heeled shoes trailed him.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Wait! Josun, wait for me.\" It was Merida. He shuddered imperceptibly, but continued walking. \"What happened? I was sitting at the bar, having a wonderful conversation with -- oh, I forget his name -- when the room suddenly went silent. You should come back and sit with us at the bar. I don't care about what happened, won't even ask.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He stopped and sighed, then turned to face her. She was quite pretty, actually. Long, flowing auburn hair with a flower pinned at the side. Almond shaped eyes that always seemed to be smiling. He wasn't being fair to her, he resented her because she represented his father's control over his life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Okay. Okay. Yeah, we need to talk, anyway.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They went back to the bar and he ordered another round of drinks. Josun was honest with Merida, which she took well. She really would be a fine wife, he just couldn't help but rebel against dad. Once the truth was out, they both seemed to be much more comfortable together, they even had some fun. They danced, they socialized, they got really, really drunk.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Several hours later, Iliana heard muffled voices, probably Josun and the butler, coming from the hall. Her room has two entrances: from the hallway, and from his room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She sat upright in the chair, clutching the book to her chest. The knob on the door to his chamber turned slowly. Josun, still very drunk, stumbled through the door and fell to his knees, skidding on the polished stone floor. Iliana scrambled to him, helping him to his feet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Sorry, I...\" He started to walk away toward the door he had just fallen through.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"How was the gala?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"How was fucking the librarian?\" He sneered over his shoulder, eyes flickering with playful malevolence, jealousy. The butler must have known.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Josun pounced, grabbing Iliana by the shoulders. She was surprised by the strength in his hands, more so by the intense look on his face. His expression was dulled by the alcohol, but the eyes blazed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Was he good?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She barely heard the question. \"Let go of me!\" She pulled away from him, knocking him off balance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One hand held on to her shoulder as she backed away, spinning him around. Josun Tristoff went down like timber, hooked his chin on the foot of the bed, his lifeless body slumped to the floor. She ran to him and turned him onto his back and checked his neck for a pulse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nobody was surprised, disappointed, or mournful when Josun died, outwardly at least, even his father. People still came to his funeral -- he was a Tristoff, afer all -- but they only came to pay their respects to his father. In other words, to kiss his ass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Iliana was tried and found not guilty of manslaughter, merely a formality. But she was still a slave to the Tristoffs. They had no where else to send her, so they put her in the kitchen. The dishroom to be exact.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

Limelight was a perfect platform for us to exploit. It was still young and fresh, the first metaverse to support direct interface via the Photon, a major advancement in VR. Photon allowed players to truly walk in their avatar's shoes, unlike its clunky haptic predecessors. Body mod surgery being very expensive was sort of a rabble filter. So, the player base was composed of two primary types of people: rubes with a lot of cash, and serious VR addicts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were neither. We were early adopters when Limelight came out, some of the first hackers to work on the platform. Made a load of cash scamming for crypto in headset VR metaverses. Being early to the scene also came with the added benefit of having short, simple handles. Mine was Skar --- short for Oskar --- and Derek's was Wreck.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A lot of people used Limelight for social reasons, hanging out with other losers, doing god knows what in private spaces. Some played games. Bloodbath was a first-of-its-kind Limelight exclusive FPS game full of rubes. We played enough to get a feel for the mechanics when it first came out, just enough to train the AI on our personal movement quirks. Everything else the AI learned as it played against real people. If I'm being honest it was not very good at winning matches, but that wasn't the point. It only needed to be convincing. Eventually, we barely played the game, mostly spectating or not paying attention at all. The hack controlled our avatars while we worked in the shell looking for wallet addresses. We could only get access to their private data if their avatar was in the same space as ours. That's what made Bloodbath so attractive. You could share a space with people distracted by the game and rob them blind. A tunnel --- hacked together by Derek --- provided two way text-only communication.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>WRECK: I think I'm on to something...</em></p><p><em>SKAR: What?</em></p><p><em>WRECK: It's plaintext something about a crypto scam.</em></p><p><em>SKAR: Like as in someone's on to us?</em></p><p><em>WRECK: No... like maybe a pump-and-dump?</em></p><p><em>WRECK: It's called LimeCoin.</em></p><p><em>WRECK: Heard of it?</em></p><p><em>SKAR: Nah should I it's probably still in dev rn.</em></p><p><em>WRECK: I got a copy let's go.</em></p><p><em>SKAR: No wallet?</em></p><p><em>SKAR: I got some brokeass... prolly cashed out to buy cosmetics.</em></p><p><em>WRECK: got nothin.</em></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We lost the game, then jumped over to Derek's private space to look over the file. It detailed a development schedule for LimeCoin, including some upcoming investor parties in the next week. Pretty typical-looking novel shitcoin; the key was tie-in. It looked like they were positioning for integration in Limelight itself. Marketing copy said it was the \"future of payment\" on the platform. There was an investor information presentation taking place in a private space tomorrow night, invite only.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What do you say. Should we go?\" Derek asked, knowing damn well we would, or at least he would.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"If we can get in silently. I mean truly silently. You're not considering buying this shitcoin, right?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Maybe,\" Derek said with a sly grin. \"Nah, let's just crash the party.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Literally? They'll find us. They obviously got some hackers.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Not like me they don't.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Let's just sit in, then see where it goes.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The document contained a private space address, a GUID --- Globally Unique Identifier. This 128-bit hexadecimal number identifies a unique container --- called a space --- paid for by a user or an org. Private spaces can optionally use a filter that permits only avatars on the list to connect. This one did. Derek had already developed a hack for ghosting his own avatar --- meaning he wouldn't appear visually or on the user list --- he would just need to apply the patch to mine. After that, all I would need to do was add our avatar IDs --- also GUIDs --- to the list.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The hacks were ready in about an hour. Derek was just so damned good at this stuff, so he was done first. My part took a little bit longer. I had to work my way to the list by hacking an avatar account, then used its credentials to insert the IDs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We agreed to meet at Derek's private space an hour before the presentation. When I ported in, he was sitting at the terminal. In-world assets were easiest to hack if you were already in-world, otherwise you had to hack the server first. Since Limelight was still newish, there were a lot of exploits still available.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Derek sat hunched over the desk, even though I'm sure at home he was lying in his bed or on a couch. His private space was decorated like a library in an old-timey mansion, like the one in the movie&nbsp;<em>Clue</em>&nbsp;where they trap the police officer. Dark-stained wooden bookshelves filled both long walls floor to ceiling, end to end. One of the short ends had a giant picture window with a view of some sharply pointed mountain peak, probably the Matterhorn. The other had a set of double doors, although they were just for show; when you go to a private space, you just port into the room as I did.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What's up?\" Derek said, not looking away from the terminal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Nada. Been logged in all day, had nothing else to do.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Mhm. Me too,\" he said, turning to me and waving me over. \"Check it out.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I looked over his shoulder at the screen, but couldn't make head or tail of what it showed. It looked like code, but not a language I'd ever seen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"It's not a programming language,\" he said, reading my mind, \"although it kinda looks like one. It's a domain specific language. Something I've been working on lately. The data that controls our AIs is completely opaque, right?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yeah, binary.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"That's the way they like it,\" Derek said, looking back at me to smile. His avatar had the appearance of an old man, a monk in a dark brown robe. \"Well, I'm trying to teach them how to present the data to us in a human-readable format. It's like a thought process digest, a diff compared to the previous run. I let the AIs name it. They came up with&nbsp;<em>SmartScript</em>. It works both ways, too. I can feed them suggestions in&nbsp;<em>SmartScript</em>&nbsp;and, if they want to, they can integrate the changes.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Honestly, I didn't care that much about AI. I was the security specialist, I broke stuff. He was the builder, a true hacker in the original sense of the word.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"About ready to port over?\" I asked, not wanting to let him get carried away with his new toy. Otherwise we would have missed the presentation entirely while he showed me everything there was to know about the language.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Give me just a sec.&nbsp;I need to prep the disappearing act.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Derek took a couple seconds to access his shell, then we ported out through a flash of white noise like rainy day clouds. Two seconds later, we were hanging from the ceiling in a small auditorium. The room was about half full, people still porting in directly in front of their seats. At 19:00 on the dot, the house lights flashed twice and some corny overture played.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An avatar dressed in a red suit ported in on the stage and the audience slowly transitioned into tentative applause. It seemed like they all knew who the guy was, but we could only see that his handle was Crow. The middle aged avatar held his hands out to the crowd, signaling quiet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"My friends,\" Crow said with a smile that never touched his eyes. \"Welcome. Welcome. Thank you for coming tonight. I won't waste your time with flashy rhetoric or gimmicks. We all know why we are here. Let's get to it.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A screen appeared floating in the air behind him. It displayed a line graph supposedly showing the decreasing purchasing power of the U.S. dollar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"The value of the Dollar, and therefore 'stable' coins,\" he actually did air quotes, \"is a depreciating asset. This is not a breakthrough, we all know this. We've all lived our lives with 5 or 10 percent less buying power than the previous year, every year.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Crow looked around the room, letting his point sink in, baiting the audience to get there before he did.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Today,\" he continued, actually smiling now, \"I'm proud to announce we are destroying the old notion of stable coins. LimeCoin.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The graphic behind him inverted, a line graph going up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"The value of LimeCoin is tied to the current inflation rate, adjusted according to the current Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation rate\" ---</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>SKAR: Whoa... there's no way that's workable.</em></p><p><em>WRECK has disconnected.</em></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ripping my Photon out of its socket at the back of by neck, sweating and short of breath, I grabbed my mobile and tried to call Derek. It went to voicemail. I tried again several times with no success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, I tried to raise him on messenger. No response there either. I was starting to get really worried. He was on the other side of the country, no way I could go check on him. He never told me where he lived, but in some feat of prescience, I hacked his profile out of curiosity. I looked up the local police and called them, asking if they would please do a wellness check and call me back. I paced my bedroom with my mobile in one hand, chewing the nails of the other.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The police never called me back. Derek's mom did the next day, less than broken up about it. She said he was found in his apartment dead, his throat slit while he was jacked in. A printed page was found stuffed in his mouth, reading \"YOU'LL NEVER GET US.\" She said the funeral would be Saturday as a simple statement of fact and then hung up. I supposed she was annoyed at the inconvenience of having to plan a funeral for her unmarried adult son. Maybe I was projecting based on the way my own mother treats me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I took a cheap flight to Ohio the next morning, checking in to a cheap hotel near the Dayton airport. The internet connection was decent, so I could still do some work while away. I thought about jacking in, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. What would I do without Derek, anyway. Instead, I just worked. I was on the books at a software-as-a-service firm as a contractor for dev ops, maintaining automation servers. Mostly writing and bug-fixing shell scripts, and investigating outages. It's not a whole lot of fun, but the pay is good and the work is intermittent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The funeral was depressing. Six people: four carboard cutouts the mortuary must have provided as part of the funeral package, Derek's mom, and me. I skipped the interment, went back to my hotel room and just cried. My only friend was gone, stolen from me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I cried myself to sleep and woke up early the next morning with bleary, puffy eyes. After a long, slow walk around the hotel grounds and the adjacent truck stop, I came back to my room and unpacked my Photon. It took me a few minutes to build up the courage to jack in.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I ported to my private space, disgusted by the sad state of it. Derek's space was where I had spent the bulk of my time inside of Limelight, so I had neglected my own space. My terminal, sat on an executive desk, and a simple leatherette desk chair were the only things in the space. Sitting down at the desk, I activated the terminal thinking I would try looking for more info about LimeCoin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Don't be alarmed,\" a familiar voice said from somewhere behind me. I glanced around the room, finding no one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"... Derek ... ?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"This is not going to be easy to explain --- 'cause I don't know what happened or how.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"This can't be real,\" I muttered.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"It can't, it shouldn't, it isn't. I don't know. I'm not real. Well, not&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;real.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I couldn't make sense of it. He was real, but not real?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Look. I got killed while I was jacked in. Maybe my consciousness got transferred to the metaverse. I don't know. It doesn't matter how it happened. What are we going to do?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"<em>We</em>? I'm going to log out and see my therapist.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You don't have a therapist,\" Derek's voice said. \"Plus, there's no time for that. LimeCoin launches in few days.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What?\" I asked, not wanting to follow along.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Lime. Coin,\" He said, punching each word. \"LimeCoin goons killed me. I'm sure of it.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"But we don't know&nbsp;<em>any</em>thing,\" I said, throwing my hands up. \"We went to one meeting that may as well have been public.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You don't know anything.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I cringed. It felt like a personal attack, like he was calling me an idiot.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"No,\" he continued, \"that's not what I meant. Sorry. I mean,&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;was the one with the file. But I didn't know anything either. That means there must be more than meets the eye in it.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before I could ask what, someone pulled the plug and put a bag over my head.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/limelight.md#chapter-2\"></a>Chapter 2</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a lengthy ride in what I assume was the back of an unmarked van, I was hauled out, dragged indoors and made to sit in a very uncomfortable chair. Hours passed in complete silence and darkness before the bag was suddenly pulled off. A moment later a light came on, illuminating a middle aged man stood directly in front of me. He wore an immaculately-fitted suit and a smirk. His eyes were bolt-on mods, opaque lenses affixed directly to his eye sockets. I doubted that was the extent of his mods.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Hello, Oskar. It is a pleasure to finally put a face to the name. My name is Niccolo Lentini, but you may call me Nico if you like.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Uhh --- nice to meet you, too.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of Nico's goons pulled a chair in, dragging it across the empty warehouse floor on its back legs. Nico glared at the man, obviously annoyed at the nails-on-chalkboard sound.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Thanks, Ricky,\" he said. As Ricky started to walk away, Nico kicked his rear foot, knocking it into the back of the other. Ricky stumbled and almost fell, but tried to play it off like he wasn't being fucked with, like it was actually funny. Nico sat in the chair leaning forward, elbows resting on knees with his hands dangling limply between. The gold bracelet on his left wrist looked like it might slip past the hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"We have a lot to talk about, my friend,\" he said after a long pause during which he just stared at me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You're not going to try to sell me LimeCoin, are you?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"No,\" he replied, with a chuckle. \"No.&nbsp;Not exactly. Actually, I want you to buy some for me.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You don't want LimeCoin, dude,\" I said, \"It's a scam. Typical pump-and-dump.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yes, well, that's beside the point ---\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Then what is the point?\" I asked, growing frustrated with his game.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"The point,\" he said, \"is that our goals are aligned, for a time.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He stood and came to stand behind me, putting a manicured hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at his touch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I understand someone very close to you was recently murdered, and I suspect you know exactly who did it and why. But perhaps you don't know&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;who did it, at least not in meat space. And I do.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Just tell me what you want from me.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Before I give up the information I have, let's come to a tentative agreement, shall we?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Ok,\" I replied, nodding, feeling the pressure. The guy was obviously mafia or something, could probably have disposed of me like a gum wrapper.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Ok,\" Nico said, lighting a cigarette and taking a long drag. \"So, let's agree that we are not enemies, and that if you don't want to help you are free to go.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Well, I agree to that, however meaningless it is.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Oh, it's not meaningless,\" he said, coming back around to sit in the chair again, \"you just don't see the subtext.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"So, it's a threat?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Not exactly,\" he said. \"You are free to go, but Lester Crosby will find you. Today, likely as not.\" He let that sink in for a couple of beats and then continued, \"See, an olive branch. I just gave you a tidbit of information to grease the deal's wheels.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had considered that the LimeCoin goons might have come for me. That's why I left L.A. in a rush. But it was not a very helpful tidbit. I could have found out Crow's name for myself if I had wanted to. In any case, I didn't see any other way out of the situation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Alright, what do you want me for? They killed the competent hacker. I only break into systems.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"It just so happens,\" He said, his smile baring teeth like a predator, \"that we really need a hacker of your particular talents.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nico waved to Ricky, who scurried over with a tablet. He handed the tablet to Nico and thanked him for some reason.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"As I was saying,\" he said, pulling something up on the tablet, \"I know that LimeCoin is a scam.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finding what he was looking for, he put the tablet in my lap. It was open to the same document Derek had found in the mark's files, scrolled to the part about the meeting schedule.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I also know why,\" he said, gloating. \"Can you guess?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Well,\" I said, \"based on the fact that I already guessed it was a pump and dump scheme, it's not a typical one at least.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"That's correct. On our turf no less,\" he said. Nico snapped his fingers, pointing at the tablet, and Ricky came to take it. \"As you may be aware, we have a controlling stake in Limelight Corporation.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I didn't really need to read the file, I had already done so several times. It wasn't very helpful as it didn't name any names, said nothing about the specifics of the scam. Maybe Nico didn't know we had the same file.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I agree to help you and you'll look out for me? Is that the deal?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"We'll give you a private room at our safehouse. The bandwidth there should be more than sufficient for your needs. What we need from you is very simple.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"One,\" he continued, counting on his fingers, \"there is another investor meeting in two days. You'll need to get an invite to this meeting using a fresh avatar we will provide.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I nodded.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Two, you will capture the IP addresses of all the attendees at that meeting. Three, you will destroy the ledger.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"But crypto are distributed. There could be thousands of instances of that ledger.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Not yet, they never had any intention for LimeCoin to become distributed. The chain is closed source, and they were planning to destroy the ledger anyways after selling their shares --- which were gotten for free, mind you --- to the investors. You destroy that ledger and the investors will riot.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Seems like the investors would riot either way.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"They have that covered. The investors would have no legal recourse. The chain was 'hacked' or some such nonsense.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Of course. How do you know all this?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You know better than I do that Limelight is insecure, especially when you have operatives on the inside. We've intercepted enough to put the pieces together.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He seemed very pleased with himself, but I still had my doubts about his plan. I decided not to argue the point further. What good would it have done?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Okay,\" I said, after several moments passed. \"But I'd rather work from my hotel room.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'm afraid that won't be possible,\" he replied, feigning remorse. \"I'm sure they already know the location. We brought your things and checked you out. Ricky here is going to bag you up and take you to the safehouse now. I'm sorry about it, but it's for your own safety. I assure you, Ricky will take good care of you.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He pointedly directed the last part to Ricky, who came over and pulled the rough black fabric back over my head.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ricky and a couple other goons took me up some stairs, head still in a bag. I heard a door open and they removed the handcuffs from my wrist, then pulled the bag off my head. With a shove, I went stumbling into the room and the door was shut and locked behind me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of my stuff was waiting for me on the bed. The shit hole was no bigger than a hotel room, but had a kitchenette crammed in too. Everything in the room was peppered with stains and the carpet almost seemed wet. The single full size bed sat unadorned in the middle of one wall. A dresser, topped by a TV, across from it. A simple desk and chair sat in front of the only window.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I looked through my backpack to make sure everything was there. It was, plus something new: a brand new Photon engraved&nbsp;<em>Lentini Investments, LLC</em>. I pulled my laptop and personal Photon out, deciding to get right to work. No sense in putting it off, the sooner I get this done the better. Not feeling very confident about writing an IP logger, I decided I should jack in and try to find Derek's ghost --- or whatever you would call it --- and get his advice.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you jacked in to Limelight, you were presented with a menu that listed available options. On my main menu were: Personal Space, Known Spaces, and Games. A Personal Space was an avatar's home and could have been anything from a small bedroom all the way up to a palatial mansion, depending on how much money a person wanted to spend. Mine was closer to the bedroom end. Known Spaces listed all the other places you had been, both public and private spaces, whether or not you currently had access. I clicked on Derek's personal space at the top of the list, which should have sent him a ping. I wasn't sure if he would respond since, you know, he was dead.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a couple seconds, he accepted the request and I ported in to his room. His space was only a little bit bigger than mine, but he had spent a lot more on items, vanities, and cosmetics. The bookshelves contained actual books --- well, technically just VR books, but they could be pulled off the shelf and read. An ornately carved wooden table sat in the center of the room, covered in papers and tablets. Derek wasn't actually in the room in a visible avatar sense, but he did greet me as soon as I appeared.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Sup.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Hey,\" I said, \"I've been abducted, so that's new.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Let me guess, my friend Nico?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What,\" I asked, \"Your friend?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Nah,\" he said with a laugh, \"Not my friend. Not yours either. He tried to get to me too, just never went so far as abducting me. He sent a proxy to visit me inside Limelight a few weeks ago.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What did he want?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Wanted me to help him get an invite to an investor presentation. Was he mad?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"As a hatter,\" I said, \"But no, he didn't seem angry. He wants the same from me. I guess now that LimeCoin is close to launching, he's getting desperate. He wants me to gather IPs at the next meeting and then destroy the ledger.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Ah, so you need some hacking assistance.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I can do the work, I just need you for moral support. Mind coming back to my space?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yes,\" he said without humor, \"I hate that place.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"But you hate when I use your terminal too, so ---\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My personal space seemed even emptier and more depressing under the additional scrutiny of an invisible dead guy. The room had only one window, through which only brilliant white light shone, no view. The walls were covered in a rough red brick texture with shoddy mortaring.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My terminal glowed on the simple desk, block cursor blinking expectantly, taunting me. The hardest part about writing hacks like this is that there is no documentation, you just have to disassemble the binaries --- if you can get them. Fortunately, Derek already knew how to get ahold of subsystem binaries, so the hard part was out of the way. I'm fairly comfortable with reading assembly language, so it was only a matter of time until I found what I needed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The amount of time it took was unfortunate. It had gotten late into the evening before I had code that I was only reasonably certain would do the trick. Derek gave it his seal of approval and I jacked out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was midnight back in meat space and I was famished. I tried the door, but it was locked. Then I remembered the kitchenette. It was just outside the bathroom at the front of the room, a small refrigerator was fit underneath a short bit of countertop. I sighed when I saw the fridge contents: bologna, American singles, and yoghurt. There was a loaf of white bread in the cabinet, so I made myself an awful sandwich using the yoghurt as a condiment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I slept restlessly that night, waking periodically, wondering where in the hell I was. Where in the hell was I, anyway? Seemed like some kind of tenement, low rent, maybe a repurposed hotel. At one point, I got out of bed and looked out the window. There was nothing to see, just the wall of the next building, an alley strewn with garbage, a group of homeless people huddled in a pile. Iron bars blocked the window, despite the fact that I was on at least the fourth floor. My designs of escaping through the window dashed, I returned to my restless sleep. Some time after daybreak, I was awoken by a knock at the door.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What?\" I hollered through the door.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Housekeeping,\" a woman said from the other side.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was almost certain that there would be no housekeeping in this dump. This was no hotel. I got out of bed to look through the peep hole and saw a twenty-something girl on the other side.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"No thanks,\" I replied, even though I knew I didn't have the ability to open the door or stop it from opening.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The deadbolt on the door unlocked with a clunk, and the knob turned. I stumbled back from the door as it opened into the room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'm not housekeeping,\" she said as she stepped into the room, \"in case you hadn't already figured it out.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yeah,\" I said, as eloquent as I'd ever been.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She was an imposing presence, despite her small size, exuding confidence almost to the point of arrogance. A laptop was tucked into her armpit, a manila folder was in her hand. It struck me as an odd combination of the modern and old-school, but there's only one way to ensure nobody can get to sensitive data. Keep it off the net.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"They spared no expense,\" she said, looking around the room. \"Got you in one of their better rooms, if you can believe it.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Hey, it's about the same size as my apartment and the internet's faster, so --- yeah, not bad. I'd rather be at home though.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Standard procedure,\" she said with a wave of her hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'm Oskar,\" I said, putting on my charm face. \"And you are?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Maria.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She came the rest of the way into the room and set the laptop down on the desk, then handed me the folder.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"This is the backstory,\" she said, \"for the Limelight avatar Nico created for you. You'll need to know this information in case he asks any questions. Lester Crosby and his guys personally vet all prospective buyers.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Why did trees need to die to bring me this information?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Let me finish. Also, the file contains details of the way that Nico wants your character to behave, things you will need to accomplish according to Nico's specification.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"So he's a micromanager. I get it.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"No comment,\" she said with a confirming smirk. \"Have a look through the documents, I'll be working on my laptop in case you have any questions.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I piled up the naked, lumpy, stained pillows at the headboard and sat down on the bed to go through the folder. The first page was a character sheet, like what you might find in the back of a pen and paper RPG player's manual crossed with a medical record. Two pages detailing the plan. The last page was a list of the avatar's supposed assets, holdings, and other financial interests. This guy was rich, but not filthy rich. Rich enough that Lester would only see dollar signs, but not rich enough to raise flags.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Ok, look,\" I said, \"I'm a practically shut in, not a con artist. And despite the fact that you all may have rigged this up perfectly, there's a decent chance I'll botch this.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You'll do fine,\" she said. \"Lester is itching to give out invites. All you need to do is collect. We could have already gotten the invite, but Nico wants to make sure that there is a degree of separation between him and Crosby. That's you.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"All right, but you have no idea about my lack of social skills.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Well I've gotten a taste,\" she said, turning to me and giving me a snarky raised eyebrow. \"And I'm sure you'll be fine.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/limelight.md#chapter-3\"></a>Chapter 3</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jacking in to someone else's avatar felt like wearing someone else's underwear. Even though this one was freshly created, it still felt dirty. Wrong. This Lentini avatar, handle&nbsp;<em>Kraft</em>, had a tall catlike character model. Lean and covered in golden fur, it was dressed in a suit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wasn't sure what rich people did in Limelight, but this avatar had direct access to a whole host of private spaces. I decided to just check one of them out to get comfortable in these chonies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A place called&nbsp;<em>O'Doyle's</em>&nbsp;caught my eye. Preview images showed a classic pub, dark and smoky. I ported in and found myself standing in front of the bar in the midst of a crowd of avatars. All of them were obviously wealthy, each one had too many cosmetics, most of them were custom character models. I just stood there among the crowd of chattering avatars, trying to play it cool, sure I was failing. This was the first time I'd ever visited a bar, but I had heard that you could get drunk inside Limelight. Obviously, I needed to know what that was like.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nico gave me a couple hundred dollars of petty cash to play with, so I waited for my turn at the bar and ordered an old fashioned. The bartender --- I assumed it was an AI --- made the drink expertly, even using digital egg white. I took my drink and tried to mingle, but everyone seemed so involved in their own conversations. Too anxious to work my way into a conversation, I just went and found a seat at the far end of the bar, sat down and rested my forearms on the padded leather edge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>WREK: Found you.</em></p><p><em>WREK: Were you planning to tell me?</em></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The messages came up as an overlay. This was the first time I'd seen it happen like that. Normally, we had to be in the terminal to see messages, but this avatar didn't have access to the terminal.

Still getting used to it.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The disorientation upon jacking in your first couple of times is a very well-known phenomenon. I hoped that this explanation would be sufficient. It was not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Who's pressuring you?\" She asked, looking at me derisively. \"The mob?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Look, I'm going to be honest with you. I talk to myself in meatspace too.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yeah, ok,\" she said, softening slightly. \"Lot's of weird people on here.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Can I get you a drink?\" I decided to cover by making it&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;awkward.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"No, thanks.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An avatar in a custom robot skin took the stool to my left.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I figured it out,\" he said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Uh, good for you.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"It's Derek, dumbass.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I guess up to that point I thought Derek's consciousness was stuck somewhere above the visual space. Here he was, back in the digital flesh.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Were you ever going to tell me?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Cute. I've got a way to get you into a meeting without doing it the hard way.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I visibly relaxed. There was no way I was going to con my way into a meeting with anyone. I knew that once I had the meeting, I could carry on a decent conversation. Hacker to hacker is easy for me to deal with. Hacker to lackey, not so much.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Oh my god,\" I said, sighing, \"you have no idea how much of a relief that is.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yes I do. That's why I spent all night working on it. This guy, goes by Crow, has several goons that set up meetings. All I had to do was go through one of their Photon accounts and put you on the list. It's in about half an hour, I barely found you in time.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Let's get out of here, then. Bars are too loud. And did they really have to make cigarettes a thing? Stinks in here.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I downed the remainder of my old-fashioned and we ported out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I jacked out for a few minutes to have another look at the avatar's made up meatspace background. Maria said it wasn't that important, that it didn't seem like Crow did thorough background checks for potential buyers. I did it anyways. I'm not an actor, I needed to get into character to really assume the role.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I jacked back in, there was a notification on the home screen asking if I was ready to port to the location --- I was ready as I would ever be --- so I selected \"Port Now.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I ported in to a waiting room that was reminiscent of a dentist's office. Small padded armchairs lined the perimeter of the room, with little tables between sets of two. One end of the room had large window, behind which sat the receptionist, the other end had a pair of doors. She --- it? --- told me it would only be a moment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Several minutes later, a green-skinned alien avatar came out of one of the offices. Its skin gave off light, even through its metallic jumpsuit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Mr.&nbsp;Crosby will see you now. Through door A, please.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I took a deep breath then entered the office. It was a stark space, nothing on the walls, only a desk facing the door. Behind the desk was a floor to ceiling window that spanned the entire wall, the view was Saturn in a field of stars. The avatar I recognized as Crow sat behind the desk fiddling with his terminal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Kraft I presume,\" he said, not looking up. \"Welcome to LimeCoin.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Thanks,\" I said. \"I've heard nothing but good things.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'm sure,\" he said, finally directing his attention to me, smiling. \"Please, have a seat.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I understand you have some interesting tech? I'm something of a hacker myself.\" God, that sounded awful as soon as it left my mouth. Did I want him to think I was trying to look at the code or something? \"I understand its a novel coin.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yes,\" he said, beaming with pride. \"I can't say I had much to do with the development. I'm an executive now, barely written a line in the last few years.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Sure,\" I said, \"but projects often don't get very far without the right vision.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I suppose so,\" he said, with a laugh. Executive types always like kiss-ass. \"So, I've been looking over your application. Impressive. If the project weren't almost done, I would offer you a job.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'm flattered,\" I said, trying to do my best at playing humility. \"You know, I considered playing with blockchain back during the bull run of 2020.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You should have! What held you back?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Trying to maintain a two-man software house,\" I said, practically reciting the backstory, \"while working on way too many side projects. I'm sure you know how that goes.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Oh yeah,\" he said. \"Sure do. I wish there were more hours in the day. Speaking of which, I'm afraid I have nothing but meetings today. I'll send your avatar an invite to the next meeting, then? Hope you'll be able to make it.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'll be there,\" I said and was immediately booted from the space.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I jacked out of one Photon and back into the other, disappointed that I was booted. I had hoped to get a chance to snoop around a bit. I ported straight into my space. He was there, waiting for me to return.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Good news or bad news?\" he asked.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What, you weren't snooping?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You're the systems guy. I'm not trying to break into every private space in Limelight.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Good and bad,\" I said, dragging a finger along the table. \"I got the invite, but failed my own goal.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Which was?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. I wanted to get into the LimeCoin systems from the inside.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Whatever man, it's another two days until that presentation. You've got time to break it.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yeah, but how cool would that have been?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hacking inside Limelight is technically no different than hacking from a laptop. It just feels so much cooler, so fresh and new and exciting. Plus, if you're on the local --- that is, connected to a public or private space owned by your target --- it's almost trivial. But I lacked the charisma to make that happen, so I have to go the boring way, breaking into the network through the net. Which meant I needed to jack out to do the next step.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I hated to leave Derek. But, honestly, I wasn't sure it was really, truly him anyways. It was hard to understand what it would be like to be digitally imprisoned.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, I had to break into the LimeCoin main server. Trivial. Small orgs often have terrible security. Next, I had to map their tiny subnet. Just the main entry point --- the net-facing public server --- and a handful of private nodes. Machines for driving Photons, a mail server, and a couple of internal tools like a private git host.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I should have hit the mail server first. No, I wasted time going through the Photon machines first, of course, finding nothing but chatter. Employees trying to hype the new coin. The mail server had the goods. I was able to brute force the password, getting root access after just a few minutes. Terrible security, like I said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I started by querying the database for \"murder.\" A thread from the day after Derek was murdered was returned. What I read made my blood run cold and boil at the same time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>FROM:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:crow@lime.coin\">crow@lime.coin</a></em></p><p><em>TO:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:griff@lime.coin\">griff@lime.coin</a></em></p><p><em>SUBJECT: Re: Was this us??</em></p><p><em>No.&nbsp;Of course it wasn't us.

As far as I could tell, the Lentinis murdered Derek to ruin LimeCoin's credibility. Or something like that. At that point, all of my research was pointing to LimeCoin being more or less innocent, at least regarding Derek's murder.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I jacked into my own Photon the morning of the big investor meeting and ported to my private space and found him there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What are you doing here?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Hey,\" Derek's said, wearing a new skin, a super-accurate samurai. He sat at my desk using my terminal. \"I never left.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Crazy news,\" I said, sitting down on the floor against the wall by the desk. \"I should have jacked in last night to tell you, but I needed time to think.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Lay it on me.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You know how I was saying I wanted to try to get access to Lester's terminal?

You're gonna give yourself a heart attack. Just give me the dirt.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I found an email from Lester claiming the Lentinis killed you.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"That makes sense,\" he said, not missing a beat. \"More sense than those LimeCoin boneheads.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I figured he would have been at least a little bit surprised, maybe even worried about&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;safety. The Lentinis were currently holding me captive. I guess he no longer had emotions. His consciousness transferred to Limelight, the neural pathways were reproduced in binary. No body, no hormones, no emotions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I have to get out of this safehouse,\" I said. \"The Lentini Photon. Do you know if they can disable it remotely?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yep. They might have it set up to only connect from known networks. In any case, they'll have it tapped. They'll find you in minutes if you even manage to get out of there.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Dammit. Ok, so I've got to go to the event tonight, destroy the ledger and&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;bolt. Maybe they won't come after me. I mean, I will have fulfilled my end of the bargain.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I wouldn't count on that.

The moment of truth. I jacked into Kraft and was promptly greeted by a notification asking if I wanted to port to the meeting space. Seconds after selecting \"Port Now,\" I appeared in the space, this time a grand ballroom. It was carpeted from wall to wall, big circular tables scattered all across the floor. At one end of the rectangular space was a dais, at the center of which stood a microphone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The room was filling fast, avatars porting in behind their assigned seats, flashes of light announcing their impending arrival. Nerves tied my stomach into a knot, feeling like I had stage fright even though I wouldn't be going on stage. The murmured conversation passed in waves across the audience echoing my own nervousness. The virus was loaded and ready in the Photon's RAM, but what if it didn't work? Would Nico have me murdered if it failed? Had he planned to do so either way?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Corny cinematic music suddenly blared from loudspeakers on either side of the dais. At that moment it struck me as odd that there were so many instances of unnecessary objects in Limelight. Meat space analogues only put there to make people feel more comfortable or at home. I guess it was because the music had to sound like it was coming from somewhere or else it would spoil the immersion. And if it was supposed to be coming from somewhere, there had better be something there for it to come from.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lester Crosby strode onto the dais, waving to thank the audience for their obligatory applause. When he reached the microphone --- another unnecessary object --- he held his hands out to signal quiet. He waited a moment after the audience was quiet to begin speaking.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"My friends,\" he said, grinning from ear to ear. \"You are pioneers. Early adopters, trailblazers. I can see the apprehension on your faces, and I can empathize. It is the fear of the unknown, same as the explorers must have felt as they left their homelands for globe-spanning voyages. We are here for a celebration. I am celebrating my vision coming to fruition. The LimeCoin engineers celebrate an end to the years-long work of creating a novel coin.\" A group of avatars --- must have been the engineers --- chuckled a bit. \"Together with you all, we celebrate a new frontier: a new currency for the metaverse.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The crowd applauded modestly. Champagne ported in on the tables in front of each member of the audience, one appeared in Lester's hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"To the new world, Limelight,\" he said, raising his glass into the air. \"To a currency by, for, and of the people of Limelight.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone raised their glasses and, once he was finished we all drank together like cult members drinking the Kool-Aid.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Today,\" he continued after downing his champagne, \"LimeCoin becomes available to you all. Tomorrow, it becomes available to the general public.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That was my cue. I switched over to the terminal.

Took me a second to focus on the room, but when I did I saw Maria standing there with my backpack in her hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Let's go,\" she said, \"hurry.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I followed Maria through dark, dingy hallways to a freight elevator at the back. We rode to the parking garage under the building and ran to her car, a dark blue Mustang probably \"on loan\" from Nico.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"We're going straight out of town,\" she said once we got into the car. \"There's nothing left here for either of us.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I didn't actually even know where \"here\" was. They brought me in a van with a hood over my head. All I knew was that it was somewhere within an hour or so of Dayton. She peeled out of the space she had backed the car into, then sped out of the garage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"WiFi hotspot,\" she said, pulling a device out of her pocket and handing it to me. It was no bigger than a mobile. \"Its active, connect your laptop to it.\" She pulled another device out of the other pocket and handed it to me. \"Plug the cable into your Photon. Jack in. Tell him the holo is ready. Derek is in control of Limelight for now. But we don't know when, or if, Limelight will come back up, so you need to be quick.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I connected the device and jacked in. She was driving at a hundred miles an hour, swerving from lane to lane, which made plugging the jack into the port on the back of my neck difficult. I idly wondered what would happen if she was caught speeding. The Lentinis probably own the highway patrol, not to mention the police. They probably already had an all-points-bulletin out for our arrest.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I finally jacked in, I was not presented with the usual menu. I ported directly to a perfectly white, perfectly empty room. Derek stood in the middle wearing his red robot skin again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"We did it, Oskar,\" he said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"It's not over yet.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"It's as good as done.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You can afford to be cavalier, Derek.

The download finished less than a minute later and I jacked out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back in meatspace the holo device was affixed to the dashboard, a glowing hologram of Derek floating above it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'm free,\" he said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Yeah,\" Maria said, \"for small values of free.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"So what now,\" I asked.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I planted tracking devices on each of the Lentinis vehicles,\" she said and gestured toward her mobile, mounted on the dash. \"The mobile will notify us when they approach and mark their location on the map.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were on the road, driving fast as hell, for about an hour when Maria's mobile chimed.

You ready?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"No,\" I replied, white-knuckling the pistol she had given me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Well, too bad.

Keep shooting.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I looked over my shoulder out the back window and saw two all-black Chargers bearing down on us. They couldn't have been more than a hundred meters back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They opened fire first, spider-webbing the back windshield. I grabbed some clips and climbed over the center console into the back seat, rolled down the window, leaned slightly out and began firing on the car on the right. My shots went wild. After I finished the first clip, I noticed I had managed to hit one headlight. So I guess I wasn't that bad after all. I loaded a fresh clip and kept shooting. Maria was swerving all over the road trying to avoid their shots. It seemed to be working because they were missing almost as many as I was.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"It's hard to shoot hanging out the window with you swerving,\" I screamed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You're doing fine,\" she said. \"Breathe. Be calm. Shoot for the drivers.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I took a deep breath, trying to stop the shakes. The mobile chimed again and I glanced forward to see that another car was approaching. A blue dot this time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"That's Nico,\" Maria said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I can't do this,\" I whispered, butterflies buzzing in my stomach, feeling like I could vomit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You can do this,\" Derek said. \"You have to.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I can't do this.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Just pretend this is Battlegrounds.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'm terrible at Battlegrounds.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I put my arm back out the window and fired another torrent of bullets. Somehow, I managed to get one of the drivers, causing them to swerve directly into the other car. Both went careening off the roadway, kicking up a cloud of smoke and dust and crashing into an embankment. Filled with a sense of accomplishment, I felt my hands become steadier. The shakes smoothed out only to come right back when I saw how quickly Nico was catching up. I loaded another clip and fired a few shots at his windshield. It must have been bulletproof, a couple of shots should have landed but there was no damage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Within seconds, he was all the way up to our bumper. He tapped it a few times and then gave up on that, swerved to go into the next lane and then pulled up beside us and did a PIT maneuver. Maria almost caught the slide, but ended up losing control and we went careening off into the grassy median. I rattled around, loose in the back seat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Shit,\" she said, \"shit shit shit.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We bumped over the rough grass for a couple hundred meters before getting stuck in a ditch at the center of the median. The car lurched to a stop and died. Maria tried to start the car, but it was toast. I looked back up the embankment and saw Nico's car stopped on the shoulder. He got out and came down the incline with a swagger I would have thought impossible through such thick grass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You should just surrender,\" Nico yelled at us over the noise of the highway. \"I've got reinforcements en route. Don't make me kill you. You're both far too useful.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Be right back,\" Derek said and his holographic image disappeared.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maria and I just looked at each other. I tried firing a shot at Nico's chest, but it just plinked off.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You shouldn't have done that,\" Nico said, devoid of emotion.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Ok. On my word, run to Nico's car,\" Derek said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"What?\" Maria and I asked in unison.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I disabled his ocular mods on a time delay,\" he said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. \"Ready... and... go!\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maria grabbed the holo unit and we bolted from the car. Nico, now completely blind, went haywire, screaming and thrashing like a madman. He fired at where he thought the car should have been. We ran a wide circle around him to his car and got in. Hearing the door slam, Nico spun around and fired a few shots, but we had already closed the doors. Maria put the car in gear and floored it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"See, I told you it wouldn't be so bad.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

The settlement seems crowded already, but I guess another couple hundred won't make a difference. They say almost five thousand are here already. My father has worked for Steinmetz since before I was born. He was one of the first to arrive, the rest of our family arrived several weeks later. Dad is an engineer, worked on the team that designed the habitation units.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I thought that the children were just brought along for future generations, but I found out today we were really brought along for labor. The youngest of us have school first thing in the morning, those of us older than 16 are evidently done with schooling, officially at least. This morning was a rude awakening.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unlike the first four days, we spend today working. I guess the first four were orientation. Some of my new friends were sent down into the mines. From what I've been able to gather, the settlement sits atop an enormous quantity of gold and silicon, coincidentally two elements we all but completely consumed on Earth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Luckily, I suppose, I was not assigned to the mines. I am being trained for the security detail. I awoke this morning to a text telling me to report to sector 7C and to check my locker for my uniform. I found there a heavy jumpsuit, dark gray denim with a&nbsp; patch over the left breast. \"SSS\" or Steinmetz Settlement Security.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The uniform was stiff and scratchy, I now have a chaffing rash inside my thighs, but at least I'm not in the mines.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/mars-colony-001-part-i.md#day-6\"></a>Day 6</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The last wave arrived mid-morning today. It was really depressing to see the wonder and excitement on their faces, knowing that probably half of them are destined to ten-hour shifts in the mines. Rumor has it that some are worked six days in a row.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My squad was ordered to supervise the arrival, to guide the new settlers to their habitation unit. I got to see inside of another unit for the first time. It was exactly identical to our own, except with a purple stripe on the wall instead of orange.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I met a girl today, her name is Cassandra. Beautiful curly golden hair, tall and curvy. We talked a bit as we walked, she's from Pittsburgh and we joked about how she \"escaped.\" I hope I get to see her again soon, and that she doesn't get assigned \"resource collection.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/mars-colony-001-part-i.md#day-7\"></a>Day 7</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There was an accident in the mine today. I was in the monitoring room being trained to use the software when it happened. It started with a quiet rumble, then a sudden crashing jolt like an earthquake. The supervisor bolted from the room and we began to follow after. He ordered us to stay, so we did. So, I put my new knowledge to use and watched what I could with the cameras, but I never saw anyone but security come up out of the mine. That is, until the shift change. The first shift came out of the mine covered in filth as usual, replaced by the second shift in clean jumpsuits. I clocked out, never did see my super again today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/mars-colony-001-part-i.md#day-8\"></a>Day 8</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Word is going around that several workers died in the accident yesterday, the number varies from a couple to two dozen depending on who you're talking to. I asked my super about it and he told me it was none of my business. I guess it wasn't.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At lunch today, I decided to hang back in the monitoring room. I went through each camera in search of Cassandra, but never found her. I guess it's because I don't have access tot he habitation cameras. Maybe I'll find her after she gets her work orders. Maybe she'll even be assigned to SSS.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I received at text about an hour before shift change today: \"ALL: report to auditorium @1630.\" Shift change is at 1700, so I was excited to get off early. The excitement only lasted until the assembly began. It was part \"welcome to the colony\" and part stern warning. Things we are not allowed to do, places we're not allowed to go, and, weirdest of all, questions we're not allowed to ask. After the meeting, dinner in the mess hall. I looked around for Cassandra, but did not see her.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/mars-colony-001-part-i.md#day-9\"></a>Day 9</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Only one thing happened today that's even worth talking about, but boy is it. At lunch, one of the miners got up on a table and started shouting. Something like, \"I know the truth! The truth they will never tell you! We're all going to die here!\" A couple of SSS guards grabbed him and dragged him out while he continued screaming, \"We're all going to die here!\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/mars-colony-001-part-i.md#day-10\"></a>Day 10</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today should have been the day that Cassandra was assigned, but I was unable to find out where she might have been assigned to. After the interruption during dinner last night, everyone in the colony seem son edge, like as if we all know we want to talk about it be are afraid. People seem to look at us SSS members as though we have the information. I guess we do, in aggregate, but we've been given very clear instructions that we are never to talk about anything we see or do int the course of our duties, even amongst ourselves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I learned something interesting ‒ maybe frightening ‒ today: there are a large number of jail cells located beneath 7C. One of them, of course, is occupied by our dinner interrupter, but there are others. After my shift, I tried to explore the colony, walking around in uniform trying to act nonchalant. I ended up outside purple habitat, but the door requires a purple id chip. I tried my own chip, it didn't work. When I turned around, an SSS guard stood right behind me. \"No one is allowed access to any habitat besides one's own,\" he said softly but firmly, with a sly grin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/mars-colony-001-part-i.md#day-11\"></a>Day 11</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've been led to believe, via rumors, that the miners have been forced to work for their eighth straight day, a leas ones that have been her long enough. I tend to believe this, you would too if you saw the defeated looks on their sallow faces. I've been made to work too, today is my sixth day. My job has to be significantly easier, though. This afternoon, I was given orders to report any group of miners talking amongst themselves by marking the feed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/mars-colony-001-part-i.md#day-12\"></a>Day 12</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I awoke today to a text: \"R&amp;R report to gym @0900.\" I thought it a bit odd at first, being told to report on my \"day off\" but hell, I thought I'd be working again today. It turned out to be an orientation and tour of the colony's rest and relaxation units. There's a gym, basketball, volleyball, tennis, exercise and weightlifting equipment. There's a movie theater, a bar for the adults, and a computer lab that connects to the Earth Internet, although very slowly. I spent my entire allotment texting my friends back home. Now, as I sit here at the desk in our compartment, the grim reality sets in: I'll not be going home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/mars-colony-001-part-i.md#day-13\"></a>Day 13</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At lunch today, I saw a couple of the miners I reported a couple days ago doing dishes in the kitchen. It seem like the light in their eyes had gone out. I mention this to my dad and he very rudely told me to shut up, now. Back at work I decided, from today onward, I'll only be logging pointless marks, just to test the system and, maybe, throw off the data.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/mars-colony-001-part-i.md#day-14\"></a>Day 14</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I saw Cassandra this morning. I was in a crowd of people headed to work when I saw her about 15 meters in front of me. When I tried to push my way through to get to her, I was interrupted by a strong hand on my bicep. It grabbed me so hard it hurt then pulled me through a doorway I had never seen before. Inside was my super and a man I had never seen before. I guess the unknown man was the one who grabbed me. He was a jacked, muscles on the the teeth type of guy. The super is the one who spoke. He said, \"Your marks yesterday were all bad. You have been given very clear instructions. If you cannot, or will not, follow them, there will be repercussions. Do you understand?\" I silently nodded, yes. Just as quickly as I had been snagged, I found myself heaved back into the throng. Cassandra was nowhere to be found.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/jechasteen.com/blob/master/fiction/mars-colony-001-part-i.md#day-15\"></a>Day 15</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The air in the colony for the past week or so has been filled with noxious tension. Each day more than the last. Sitting in the monitoring room, just watching my own terminal, I was interrupted by one of my associates. He shouted, \"Oh my god!\" and we all turned to look. \"You all need to see this.\" Of course, all of us needed to see it, so we gathered around his terminal to see a mass of workers piling out of the mines. The were marching. After about three seconds, his feed was cut. We all stood there silently for about a minute. Then the super walks in the room and tells us we saw nothing. If only it were that easy. It would seem that a revolt has begun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

The room is empty, except for the cleaning bot who is using one of its utility arms to vacuum dust from a bookshelf. The terminal desk is at standing height, in the corner opposite the door. Mitch leaves the TV on for the bot.‌</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the next room, Mitch is reclined on a sofa, sipping on a glass of whiskey. He smacks his lips annoyingly after every sip, followed by a grotesque \"ah!\" He's scrolling through jobs listings on his phone, its screen reflects off of his glasses like a fun house mirror. \"Here we go,\" he says, having found what he thinks will be an interesting job‌.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mitch, along with about half a billion other people, lives in Chicago. The great lakes region split from the US after a civil war we know as the Water War. This region became Great Lakes, with Chicago as its capital. Splitting from the union did not save the water, however, people never changed their consumption habits, and sharing the lakes with Canada did not help. By the turn of the twenty-second century, the water level of all five lakes was in a grim state. The aquifers are drying up too.‌</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>His apartment is an efficiency unit toward the top of one of the hastily-built towers erected for the purpose of providing housing for the millions upon millions of immigrants seeking water. It has only 2 rooms: a bedroom, and a common room containing a living space and the kitchen. Each room has one window, barely big enough to fit your head out. There was a rash of building-jumpers in the late twenty-first century, code now requires the windows of high-rise buildings to be one foot squares. Still big enough for some particularly motivated, or small, individuals.‌ ‌‌ ‌There are no decorations on the walls, no extraneous furniture. He has 2 plates, a bowl, one fork, and the glass he's now drinking his whiskey from. He spends most of his time aboard his company-owned T1, a Volvo T1000, only returning to Chicago for R&amp;R.‌</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He sets his glass down on the floor and stands up, stretching his arms up over his head with a satisfied grunt. He bends down, picks the glass up, and walks over to the window. Through it he sees mostly yellow smog, with hints of buildings and vehicles here and there. People said climate change was a lie, it wasn't. The average wintertime temperature in Chicago is now 35 degrees, you can imagine what the summers are like.‌</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Hank, what's the date?\"‌</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Today is Thursday, February 13, 2105.\"‌</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mitch lets out a huge yawn with another stretch. \"Thanks, send a message to the crew: 'Meet at O'Hare Monday, 9am. Details will follow.'\"‌</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mitch is the Captain of the Merchant Marine vessel, the <em>Magna Concordia</em>. For a long time, the T1 spec was just a placeholder, room left for the future. Volvo introduced the T1000 late last year. It was the first time a firm had been able to produce a vessel the size of an aircraft carrier that can achieve escape velocity. Mitch, ruthless and unforgiving, got the nod to captain its maiden voyage.‌ ‌‌In the intervening months, the <em>Magna</em> has made 4 trips: a low orbit flex, two from Earth to Mars, and one supply run to the outer rim installation.‌</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Hank, get me a taxi to O'Hare.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He's been at home since Saturday, and starting to get cabin fever.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Done.

The hallway is very dark, lit only by the tiny windows at either end. He makes his way to the elevator and presses the call button. As he waits for the elevator to arrive, he checks his phone. There's a text from Alice, his sometimes-girlfriend.‌</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Can you come by sometime? We need to talk.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No, he thinks, and then slides the phone back into his pocket. The elevator arrives and the doors slide open to reveal a completely unlit interior. He steps on and the doors close behind him. It takes about 15 seconds to reach the ground floor, where the doors take way too long to open. When they do, the light coming through the giant glass windows of the apartment's common area blinds him. He shields his eyes with his hand and steps off of the elevator.

I don't have a whole lot of experience with GUI frameworks, although I have developed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/jechasteen/gratuitous\">a rudimentary IDE for awesome window manager themes/configs</a>. That project was done in Qt4, which has a lot of similarities to Gtk --- although I suppose all GUI libraries share similarities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The project I'm currently working on needs to have a component that displays a nested tree for navigating documents. For the last week or so, I've been auditioning libraries in a couple different languages, namely C++ and Python. But just the other day, I discovered that there are JavaScript bindings to the entire Gnome family of libraries. They call this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gjs.guide/\">GJS</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unfortunately, the documentation for the bindings reference the C documentation and many of the examples to be found on the internet are either in C or Python. Although there are definitely some examples to be found out there, they do not cover the Gtk.TreeView object in the TreeModel form. Rather, the examples show ListModel implementations, which are very similar but do not require parent-child relationships. So, I've had to find my way on my own.

I did all the planning, plotting, and writing in Scrivener. I won't be using Scrivener again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This isn't a Scrivener review, really. But it sort of is, too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Obviously, the fact that I will not be using Scrivener for future projects is a sort of review in and of itself. I know that a lot of people find Scrivener to be the perfect all-in-one solution, some even swear by it. \"Jack of all trades, master of none.\" But that's all I'm going to say about Scrivener.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So now I'm working on my next project, dipping my toes into a few different tools to see what I might like to use for my next project. I have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/\">joplin</a>&nbsp;instance running on a server already, set up to keep my notes up to date on my laptop and my phone. It's something I've been using for months now---for keeping all sorts of notes, not just fiction-related stuff---so that's where I'll be keeping notes and outlines. I've tried using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vim.org/\">vim</a>&nbsp;for the actual writing, but it's cumbersome and honestly just doesn't have the right aesthetic. I dabbled a little with an app called novelWriter, an open-source all-in-one tool in the Scrivener vein. There are a few others, but I'm not even going to mention them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I've decided for this next project to use Joplin for note taking and outlining, and LibreOffice for writing. It's sort of jumping the gun to look for a manuscript template this early in the process---I should be&nbsp;<em>writing</em>!---but I needed to know that I can actually use the software for writing. And digging around in the \"guts\" of software really lets me put it through its paces and learn its capabilities. To that end, I have developed a template for fiction manuscripts, prepared by comparing advice from a number of blogs and websites. It may not fulfill every single publisher's requirements, but it should be a good starting point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First of all, the title page is filled automatically using&nbsp;<em>metadata</em>, information filled into a form. You shouldn't need to type anything into the title page, even the word count is handled automatically, rounded to the nearest thousand words. This is done using a variable field known as an insert formula (Insert &gt; Field &gt; More fields ... &gt; Variables &gt; Insert Formula) with the formula</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><code>WORD DIV 1000 ROUND 0 MUL 1000</code></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>with the format \"-1,235\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":124,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"http://www-wordpress.jechasteen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/titlepage.png\" alt=\"Title page preview\" class=\"wp-image-124\"/><figcaption>Title Page Example</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most sources say that the title should come about 1/3 of the way down the title page. This was done by counting total lines and dividing by three. There may be a better way to do this---and if there is please&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jechasteen.com/contact/\">send a message</a>&nbsp;and let me know.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From what I could gather, manuscripts should really only have one heading type inside the body of the manuscript: Chapter Headings. By using the custom \"Chapter Heading\" style after a page break, the chapter heading will be placed on the page just under half way down. The setting that I think looked the best ended up being 3.33 inches from the top margin, or 4.33 inches from the top of the page. Sources say that the Chapter heading should come between 1/3 and 1/2 of the way down the page. I think that this setting strikes a good balance. It sets off the start of the chapter well, but leaves plenty of room to fit 13 lines of text. (this is approximately 1/2 the page in terms of line count)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":126,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"http://www-wordpress.jechasteen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/chapterpage.png\" alt=\"Chapter Page Example\" class=\"wp-image-126\"/><figcaption>Chapter Page Example</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The text in the template is instructions on how to use the template, and a few instructions on manuscript formatting in general. I won't repeat them here. They'll make more sense once you've loaded up the template anyway.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://next.jechasteen.com/s/FXQw9EkjseSAoij\">Download Novel Manuscript Template (.ott)</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

I'm running Fedora 35 with Gnome as the base desktop environment with Openbox as the window manager. In other words, I am running GDM and then selection Openbox as my default session. This comes with a few advantages: I get some of the niceties that come with Gnome, but the lightweight and customizable experience of openbox.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But of course there's a hitch. I was trying to get the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://draculatheme.com/gtk\">Dracula GTK theme</a>&nbsp;to work under Openbox with no success. I searched high and low on the internet for help, but a lot of it was outdated because of a relatively recent switch to systemd from gnome daemons. That means that the suggestions to run&nbsp;<code>gnome-settings-daemon</code>&nbsp;were right out. Of course, the first thing I had tried, the&nbsp;<code>gnome-tweaks</code>&nbsp;tool, didn't work either. Neither did changing settings via the command line. I was at the end of my rope.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then I found out there's another tool out there for choosing GTK themes:&nbsp;<code>lxappearance</code>, which I never would have considered as I don't have LXDE installed. And you don't even need to install LXDE to use the tool. It worked immediately!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hope this information is helpful!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
